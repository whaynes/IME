         <introduction>
            <p>Ships are dangerous places to live and work for many reasons, some general, and some specific to the marine environment.  These include dynamic and unpredictable marine conditions, extended working hours with small crews, hazardous cargos, isolated work settings, and the potential for fire, explosion, collision, and sinking.</p>
            <p>Everyone aboard needs to be aware of the potential hazards, actively engage in safety measures, and be prepared to respond to emergencies.  Safety is not solely the responsibility of designated officers or management but is a collective responsibility shared by all onboard. </p>
            <p>In this chapter we discuss some of the hazards you may encounter aboard ship, approaches to managing and reducing risk, and some things you can do personally do to protect yourself, your shipmates, the vessel, and the environment.</p>

            <title>Hazards in the workplace</title>
            <introduction>
               <p>In any workplace, including aboard a ship, exposure to safety hazards is inevitable due to the nature of the work environment. These hazards can have serious repercussions such as injuries, operational disruptions, equipment damage, financial loss, environmental harm, and even loss of life. </p>
               <p>Identifying, addressing, and avoiding hazards is crucial to maintaining a safe working environment, protecting yourself and others. In this section we describe some common workplace hazards which you should be aware of.</p>
            </introduction>
            <subsection xml:id="slips-trips-falls">
               <title>Slips, Trips and Falls</title>
               <p>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, slips, trips, and falls cause nearly 700 fatalities per year and many more injurious accidents in the workplace,</p>
               <p>Common trip and fall hazards include obstructions on walkways, such as cables, tools, or equipment left in pathways. Uneven surfaces, loose gratings, and obstructions, can also contribute to tripping incidents. Additionally, poor lighting, cluttered work areas, improper storage of materials, and inadequate lighting can increase the risk of trips and falls.  </p>
               <p>Spilled liquids, oils, or water can make surfaces extremely slippery. Wet surfaces due to cleaning or maintenance activities, and the presence of loose debris are additional factors that can contribute to slip incidents.</p>
               <p>Falls can be particularly dangerous when you are working at above the ground, such as on a ladder, scaffolding or staging.</p>
               <p>Aboard ship, additional hazards exist due to the dynamic and often wet environment. Obstructions such as hatch combings, pad-eyes and container hold-downs can cause individuals to trip. Slip hazards arise from seawater or rainwater on deck surfaces, spilled liquids in galley areas, or lubricants used for machinery maintenance.  In rough seas, the motion of the ship can cause unsecured objects to fall, or cause you to lose your balance and fall. You must be particularly careful when working at heights or over the side. Always follow the old adage, “one hand for the ship and one hand for yourself.</p>

               <p>Here are some of the main hazards associated with electricity:</p>
               <paragraphs>
                  <title>Electrical Shock</title>
                  <p>The most immediate and dangerous hazard of electricity is electrical shock. When a person comes into contact with an electrical voltage, current can pass through their body, causing electrical shock. </p>
                  <p>Roughly speaking, the greater the current, the more severe the shock.  High voltage presents more danger than lower voltages, but even normal household voltage (120 V AC) can cause severe shock or even death.</p>
               </paragraphs>
               <paragraphs>
                  <title>Electrical Fires</title>
                  <p>Electrical malfunctions can generate heat and sparks, leading to electrical fires. Faulty wiring, overloaded circuits, damaged electrical cords, and short circuits are common causes of electrical fires. These fires can quickly spread and pose a significant risk to property and life. The combination of electricity and flammable materials increases the likelihood of a fire and makes it more challenging to extinguish.</p>
               </paragraphs>
               <paragraphs>
                  <title>Arc Flash and Arc Blast</title>
                  <p>
                     <term>Arc flash</term> refers to the release of intense heat, light, and energy that occurs during an electrical fault or short circuit. It is characterized by a sudden and violent discharge of electrical energy through the air. The arc flash generates extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit (19,400 degrees Celsius). The intense heat emitted during an arc flash can cause severe burns to anyone in its vicinity. Additionally, the arc flash produces a bright flash of light, which can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <term>Arc blast</term>, on the other hand, refers to the high-pressure shockwave produced by the rapid expansion of air during an arc flash. The rapid expansion of these vapors creates a blast wave that can cause significant physical damage. Arc blasts can result in powerful pressure waves, similar to those generated by an explosion, which can cause injuries, such as concussions, fractures, hearing loss, and even fatalities. The arc blast can propel debris, molten metal, and hot gases, further exacerbating the risk to individuals in the vicinity.</p>
               </paragraphs>
               <paragraphs>
                  <title>Electrical Burns</title>
                  <p>Electrical burns occur when electric current passes through the body, generating heat. These burns can be internal or external, depending on the path the electricity takes. Electrical burns can cause extensive tissue damage and may require specialized medical treatment. The severity of electrical burns depends on the voltage, current, duration of contact, and the body's resistance.</p>
               </paragraphs>
               <paragraphs>
                  <title>Electrocution</title>
                  <p>In the most severe cases, electric shocks can lead to electrocution, resulting in death. High-voltage shocks can cause cardiac arrest, severe internal injuries, and other life-threatening conditions. Contact with overhead power lines, unauthorized access to electrical panels or equipment, and improper handling of live wires are some situations that can lead to fatal accidents.</p>
               </paragraphs>
               <assemblage xml:id="safety-effects-of-electrical-current-on-the-human-body">
                  <title>Effects of Electrical Current on the Human Body</title>
                  <p>Electrical shock occurs when current passes through the body.  The severity of the shock depends on the current’s magnitude, the duration, the contact area, and the path taken by the current through the body. </p>
                  <p>The shock current received obeys <xref provisional="ohms-law">Ohm’s law</xref>, so high voltages are always more dangerous.  But your body resistance is equally important.  Body resistance with dry skin may be above 100,000 ohms, However, if the skin is wet or broken, the body's resistance decreases to a few thousand ohms.</p>

               <p>Fatigue, which refers to a state of extreme tiredness and lack of energy, can pose several risks.   The primary cause of fatigue is insufficient or poor-quality sleep.  To avoid fatigue, it's important to prioritize adequate rest and sleep, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
               <p>Other factor which can contribute to fatigue include: medical conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, anemia, and thyroid disorders; depression and anxiety, and unhealthy lifestyle habits, including inadequate physical activity, poor nutrition, excessive caffeine or alcohol intake, and smoking. Certain medications have fatigue as a side effect. </p>
               <p>The negative consequences of fatigue include:</p>
               <p>Fatigue can significantly impair cognitive abilities, including attention, concentration, memory, and decision-making. This can lead to reduced performance and increased errors, particularly in tasks that require sustained focus or critical thinking, such as driving, operating machinery, or performing complex work.</p>
               <p>Fatigue can slow down reaction times and impair alertness, making it more challenging to respond quickly and appropriately to stimuli or unexpected events. This can increase the risk of accidents, both in occupational settings and during activities like driving or operating heavy equipment.</p>
               <p>Fatigue-related impairment can lead to an increased risk of accidents and injuries across various domains, including workplaces, roadways, and other high-risk environments. Fatigue-related accidents have been linked to major incidents in industries such as transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing.</p>
               <p>Fatigue can impair an individual's ability to assess risks accurately and make sound judgments. This can result in poor decision-making, potentially leading to safety hazards or negative consequences in various aspects of life, including personal relationships and professional responsibilities.</p>
               <p>The IMO has developed guidelines for rest requirements to address the issue of fatigue among seafarers. These guidelines are outlined in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention). </p>
               <p>The STCW Convention sets out minimum hours of rest for seafarers. The standard requires that seafarers receive a minimum of 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period and a minimum of 77 hours of rest in any 7-day period. The hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, with one period being at least 6 hours in length.</p>
               <p>In situations where the safety of the ship, crew, or passengers is compromised, and in cases of emergencies or drills, the rest period may be temporarily shortened or interrupted. However, the seafarers should be provided with compensatory rest as soon as possible.</p>

               <title>Job Hazard Analysis</title>
               <p>A <term>job hazard analysis</term> (JHA), also known as a job safety analysis (JSA), is a systematic process used to identify and analyze potential hazards or risks associated with specific job tasks or activities. Its primary purpose is to reduce the risk of accidents by identifying potential hazards and developing appropriate controls to mitigate them.</p>
               <p>The process typically involves breaking down a job into its individual steps  and examining each step to identify potential hazards. Hazards can include physical hazards (e.g., machinery, equipment, or environmental conditions), chemical hazards (e.g., exposure to hazardous substances), biological hazards (e.g., exposure to infectious agents), ergonomic hazards (e.g., repetitive motion or lifting heavy objects), or any other factors that could pose a risk to worker safety and health.</p>
               <p>The key steps in conducting a job hazard analysis typically include: 
<ol>
                     <li>Select the job or task to be analyzed.</li>
                     <li> Break down the job into steps.</li>
                     <li> Identify potential hazards for each step.</li>
                     <li>
                        <p> Determine the risk level for each identified hazard.  Risk level multiplies severity and the likelihood of each identified hazard.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li> Develop hazard controls to eliminate or minimize the hazards. This might include engineering controls (e.g., machine guarding), administrative controls (e.g., training or procedures), or personal protective equipment (PPE)</li>
                     <li> Communicate the findings to workers and stakeholders to ensure awareness and buy-in.</li>
                     <li>Regularly review and update the job hazard analysis.</li>
                  </ol>
               </p>
               <p>This results of the JHA can be shared with the crew during a <term>toolbox talk</term> in order to raise awareness about known hazards, reinforce safe work practices, and promote a culture of safety. These talks are usually conducted before the start of the work day.</p>
               <p>Systematically analyzing and communicating job hazards and implementing appropriate controls helps to create a safer workplace. </p>

It is a written authorization that specifies the work to be performed, identifies the potential hazards involved, and outlines the necessary precautions and safety measures.</p>
               <p>Permits to work are required for dangerous jobs such as hot work  (welding or burning), confined space entry, working at heights, electrical work, handling hazardous substances, hoisting operations, etc. </p>
               <p>The permit to work system is designed to prevent accidents, injuries, and damage to the ship and its equipment by ensuring that work activities are conducted in a controlled manner. It helps to manage high-risk tasks and ensure that proper procedures are followed. </p>

            <title>Personal Protective Equipment</title>
            <introduction>
               <p>Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and other work accessories designed to create a barrier against workplace hazards. It provides an important link in the chain of workplace safety, but PPE alone is not a substitute for safe engineering design, proper training, good work practices, safety awareness, or hazard reduction. All these elements together are required to minimize the danger of workplace hazards and maximize the safety and health of workers.   </p>
               <p>Using personal protective equipment requires hazard awareness and training on the part of the user. You must be trained to know when personal protective equipment is necessary, what type is necessary, how it is to be worn, and what its limitations are, as well as know its proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal. In addition, you must be aware that the equipment does not eliminate the hazard. If the equipment fails, you can be injured. To reduce the possibility of failure, equipment must be properly fitted, and maintained in a clean and serviceable condition. </p>
               <p>To protect yourself, you must be wearing the proper personal protective when it is needed and recognize its limitations. The equipment must not be altered or removed even though you may find it uncomfortable. In some cases however, the equipment may be uncomfortable because it does not fit properly. </p>
               <p>In this chapter we will discuss some of the personal protective equipment normally found and used aboard ship. </p>
            </introduction>
            <subsection xml:id="safety-head-protection">
               <title>Head Protection</title>
               <p>Head injuries are caused by falling or flying objects, or by bumping your head against a fixed object. Head protection, in the form of protective hats, must do two things – resist penetration and absorb the shock of the blow. This is accomplished by making the shell of the hat of a material hard enough to resist the blow, and by utilizing a shock-absorbing lining composed of headband and crown straps to keep the shell away from the wearer’s skull. Protective hats are also used to protect against electric shock. </p>
               <figure xml:id="fig_head_protection">
                  <caption> Head Protection  </caption>

                  </sidebyside>
               </figure>
               <p>There are several types of hard hats available, each designed for specific purposes and levels of protection. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Class G (General) </term>hard hats and caps are intended for general service and they provide protection against impact hazards and a limited protection against electrical shock (up to 2,200 V). They are used in industries such as construction, manufacturing, mining, and shipbuilding. This is the most suitable hard hat for shipboard use. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Class E (Electrical)</term> hard hats are utility service hats which are designed to protect the wearer’s head from impact and penetration by falling or flying objects and from high-voltage shock (up to 20,000 V). They are used extensively by electrical workers. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Class C (Conductive)</term> hard hats or caps, are designed to be light and comfortable while protecting against impact hazards, but they <em>do not</em> provide any protection against contact with electrical conductors Class C hats often have a front brim to protect the face from sun, reduce glare, and help shed rain. They are used on occasions where there is a possibility of falling objects or bumping the head, but no risk of electrical shock. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Bump caps</term> are less obtrusive than hard hats and are designed to provide comfortable, lightweight but limited protection against minor head bumps, knocks, and scrapes in environments where there is a risk of hitting the head on objects such as low ceilings, beams, or equipment. They are not meant a substitute for a hard hat because they do not afford protection from high electrical shock, high impact forces, or penetration by falling objects.  Bump caps must not be used in situations where a hard hat is required.</p>
               <p>Correct adjustment and fit of the your hard hat is required for maximum safety. The internal cradle of the headband and sweatband forms a suspension system which keeps the helmet away from the head and cushions against impact. The headband must be adjusted to the right size in order to provide sufficient clearance between the shell and the headband. </p>
               <p>Before using a hard hat you should inspect it for signs of damage or abuse of the helmet or any of its parts. A damaged helmet reduces the margin of safety the hat was designed to supply, and should be replaced immediately. </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection xml:id="safety-eye-protection">
               <title>Eye Protection</title>
               <p>Every day more than 1,000 eye injuries occur in American workplaces. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that three out of five workers who suffered eye injuries were not wearing eye protective equipment at the time of the accident, and when asked why, the victims often claimed that eye protection was not normally used in their type of work, or it was not required for the type of work performed at the time of the accident. Eye protection can save your sight, but you must be wearing it. </p>
               <p>Eye injuries can occur in many ways, but are primarily caused by rapidly flying objects. The BLS found that almost 70% of eye injuries were caused by flying or falling objects or sparks striking the eye. Most of these objects were smaller than a pin head, and were traveling faster than a hand-thrown object. Another 20% of eye injuries were caused by chemicals, and the remainder due to miscellaneous causes such as objects swinging into the eye, pulled into the eye or by light radiation.</p>
               <p>Eye injuries can be prevented by wearing effective eye protection. To be effective, the eyewear must be of the appropriate type for the hazard encountered and properly fitted. The BLS survey found that 94% of the injuries to workers wearing eye protection were caused by objects or chemicals going around or under the protector. Goggles provide better protection than face shields or safety glasses, but the best protection is afforded when both goggles and a face shield are worn together. </p>
               <p>The three main types of eye protection for general maintenance are safety glasses, goggles, and face shields. In addition, when welding, specialized equipment must be used to protect your eyes. Each method of eye protection has its own advantages and disadvantages. </p>
               <figure xml:id="fig_eye_protection">

               </figure>
               <p>
                  <term>Safety glasses</term> are lightweight glasses that have shatter resistant lenses made of materials like polycarbonate or propionate plastic and often have side shields attached to the side pieces. Safety glasses are designed to stop flying objects such as chips, fragments, sand, and dirt from injuring your eyes. They also can provide laser light filtration to prevent reflections from the laser entering the eye and causing retinal burns. Safety glasses can be purchased with prescription lenses including bifocals if necessary. </p>
               <p>The main advantage of safety glasses is that they are lightweight and relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The provide little to no protection from liquids or vapors, and some flying particles may get around the side shields. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Safety goggles</term> provide more complete protection of the eye than safety glasses, since they protect against both frontal and side impact. They come in two different types, vented and non-vented. Vented goggles are used to protect your eyes from splashes and flying objects, while Non-vented Goggles additionally protect your eyes from hazardous vapors, mists, and fumes. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Face shields</term> are designed to augment other types of eye protection and are not meant to be a stand alone form of eye protection. Face shields are used to protect your entire face with goggles on under the shield to catch any liquids that might make it past the shield. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Welding helmets</term>  are specialized helmets are used by welders to protect their eyes and face from the intense light, sparks, and heat generated during welding processes. They often feature auto-darkening lenses that adjust the shading based on the brightness of the welding arc.</p>
               <p>Always wear a welding helmet when arc welding. Your eyes, face, and neck need protection against the burning rays of the arc, and from the splatter of molten metal and slag. To protect your eyesight, make sure the welding helmet has a colored lens with at least a No. 10 shade when welding with 200 amperes or less. And never strike a welding arc before your helmet is in place. Never look at an arc from any distance with your naked eyes while someone else is welding. </p>
               <p>Never chip slag when your eyes (or those of others nearby) are not protected by goggles, an eye shield, or the clear lens of a welding helmet. If fragments of hot slag were to hit the eye, medical attention would be required for their removal, and blindness could result. The risk of permanent eye injury is so great that you should never chip slag from a weld without protecting your eyes. </p>

            <subsection xml:id="safety-hearing-protection">
               <title>Hearing Protection</title>
               <p>Over the years, many marine engineers have suffered permanent hearing loss due to hours of exposure to the high noise levels in the engine room. You can prevent the loss of your own hearing by using proper hearing protection such as earplugs and earmuffs religiously whenever you are exposed to loud noises. </p>
               <p>Your ear is a delicate instrument which contains thousands of fine hair cells called cilia to detect sounds. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can injure or break these cells or even tear off groups of these cells. Since the hair cells don’t ever repair themselves, when enough of them are damaged, a hearing loss results. </p>
               <p>Short, intense, sounds such as an explosion can cause immediate and permanent hearing loss, but most hearing loss occurs gradually due to prolonged exposure to high noise levels. Most of the time this loss is so gradual that you are not even aware that it is occurring. Hearing loss is progressive and will continue to get worse as you continue to expose yourself to a noisy environment, but if you can avoid further exposure, the hearing loss won’t get any worse. </p>
               <p>Permanent hearing loss is not the only hazard associated with noisy environments. Tinnitus is a condition where a ringing or roaring sound is heard continuously in one or both ears. Tinnitus occurs when the hair cells are damaged in such a way that they produce sound signals to the brain even in the absence of actual stimulation. This noise is sometimes described as like having a cricket permanently stuck in your ear, and is very annoying. </p>
               <p>Sound intensity is measured in units of <term>decibels</term> (dB). The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale in which 0 dB indicates the quietest sound that can be heard by a normal person. A quiet library is about 20 dB. A normal conversation occurs at a sound level of about 60 dB. A lawnmower produces about 85 dB, and at this level you should be wearing hearing protection. Sandblasting or a rock concert has a sound intensity of about 115 dB. At this level hearing damage can occur after only about 15 minutes of unprotected exposure. </p>
               <p>According to OSHA regulations, when the 8 hour average noise exposure is above 85 dB, employers are required to institute a noise monitoring program, provide adequate hearing protectors, and ensure employees wear them. Continual, unprotected exposure to noises louder than 85 decibels for 8 hours or more can be dangerous, and may result in hearing loss. </p>
               <p>You can easily tell if you should be wearing hearing protection. If you find yourself in a situation where it is too noisy to carry on a conversation at arms length, or if you notice that your ears ring or feel plugged for a time after leaving a noisy environment, you can be sure that you should have been wearing your hearing protection. </p>
               <p>Here are some commonly available hearing protection devices:</p>

               <p>
                  <term>Disposable foam plugs</term> Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each person’s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Reusable, pre-molded plugs</term> Pre-molded plugs are made from silicone, plastic or rubber and are manufactured as either as a custom fit,  or are available in several standard sizes. Be sure to choose the proper size for your ear canals. In some cases, different size plugs may be required for each ear. The advantage of pre-molded plugs are that they are inexpensive, reusable, washable, convenient to carry, and come in a variety of sizes. Nearly everyone can find a plug that will be comfortable and effective. Another advantage is that in a dirty environment like the engine room, you don’t need to handle or roll the tips. You insert this type of plug by reaching over your head with one hand to pull up on your ear. Then use your other hand to insert the plug with a gentle rocking motion until you have sealed the ear canal. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Hearing Bands</term> Hearing Bands, also called canal caps or semi-insert devices often resemble earplugs on a flexible plastic or metal band. The earplug tips of a canal cap may be a formable or pre-molded material. Some have headbands that can be worn over the head, behind the neck or under the chin. The main advantage of canal caps is their convenience They are easy to put on and take off . When it’s quiet, employees can leave the band hanging around their necks, but they can quickly insert the plug tips when hazardous noise starts again. These devices are ideal for intermittent use, but they provide less protection than either plugs or muffs. Some people find the pressure from the bands uncomfortable. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Over-the-Ear Earmuffs</term> These are designed to cover the entire ear and provide a physical barrier to block out noise. They are often adjustable for a better fit.</p>

                  <p>The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first let’s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power <m>P_1</m>, and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power <m>P_2</m>, but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by <me>10 \log (P_2/P_1) \text{ dB}</me> where the log is to base 10. </p>
                  <p>If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is <me> 10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 2 = 3 \text{ dB}</me>. If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be <me>10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 10 = 10 \text{ dB}</me>B. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be <me> 10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 1,000,000 = 60 \text{ dB} </me>. This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size. </p>
                  <p>Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, <m>p</m>. The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of <m>x</m> is just <m> 2 \log x </m>, this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with <m>p_1</m> and <m>p_2</m> is defined as: <me> 20 \log (p_2/ p_1) \text{ dB}</me> where the log is to base 10. </p>
                  <p>This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries. So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that <m>20 \log (p_2/p_1) = 86 </m> dB where <m>p_1</m> is the sound pressure of the reference level, and <m>p_2</m> that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: <m>\log (p_2/p_1) = 4.3 </m> dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long. </p>
                  <p>What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level <me> = 20 \log (p / p_{ref}) = 20 \log 1 = 0 \text{ dB}</me>. So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals. </p>

               <title>Respiratory Protection</title>
               <p>A respirator is a face piece, hood, or helmet that is designed to protect the user from a variety of harmful airborne agents. Respirators can protect you from dust and particulates in the air, hazardous vapors, oxygen deficiency, or a combination of these. Respirators are not necessary for routine operations in the engine room, but may be advisable during certain maintenance procedures such as chipping and painting. </p>
               <p>OSHA regulations require that respirators shall be used in the following circumstances: <ul>
                     <li>Where exposure levels exceed the <term>permissible exposure limit</term> (PEL), during the time period necessary to install or implement feasible engineering and work practice controls; </li>
                     <li>In those maintenance and repair activities and during those brief or intermittent operations where exposures exceed the PEL and engineering and work practice controls are not feasible or are not required; </li>
                     <li>In regulated areas; </li>
                     <li>Where the employer has implemented all feasible engineering and work practice controls and such controls are not sufficient to reduce exposures to or below the PEL; and, </li>
                     <li>In emergencies. </li>
                  </ul>
               </p>
               <p>Before using a respirator you should be thoroughly trained in its use. Some of the areas that you should be familiar with include: respiratory hazards; respirator selection criteria, limitations, adjustment, fit, cleaning, and storage procedures, etc. The selection of a suitable respirator depends on the hazard to which you are exposed, and the correct respirator cannot be selected without a thorough understanding of the hazard. </p>
               <p>OSHA divides respirators into two categories:</p>

               <title>Arm and Hand Protection</title>
               <p>The National Safety Council has found that hands are the body part most frequently injured on the job. Accidents to the hand fall into these categories: abrasions, cuts, punctures, crushes, contact with moving machinery, burns, and chemical injuries. Gloves and hand protection are available to protect you from nearly all of these hazards. However, glove selection must be based on performance characteristics of the gloves, conditions, durations of use, and hazards present. One type of glove will not work in all situations. </p>
               <p>In the engine room, particular hazards include high temperatures and moving machinery. Long sleeved shirts are advisable to protect your arms, and you should always have a pair of work gloves available to use when necessary to protect your hands when working around hot pipes. Special high temperature gloves should always be worn when changing burners, and the appropriate chemical resistant gloves should be worn when working with burner cleaning and boiler chemicals. You should also pay particular attention to avoid contact with moving parts of machinery or power tools with moving parts, and insure that safety guards are always in place. Gloves should always be inspected for damage before use. </p>

               <title>Foot Protection</title>
               <p>Your feet are vulnerable to many potential hazards aboard ship. For example, slips and falls due to wet and slippery decks; heavy objects falling on or rolling over your foot because of the ship’s motion or accident; punctures caused by stepping on sharp objects; and potential electrical shock when your body is grounded through the soles of your shoes. In other industries, there are other hazards to consider, chemical exposure, high temperatures, molten metal splashes, static electricity, to name a few. Proper selection of footwear can minimize the danger of these hazards. </p>
               <p>OSHA has established regulations for safety shoe design, including impact and compression strength requirements, and they have mandated footwear requirements for many industries. For example, safety shoes or boots with impact protection are required to be worn in work areas where carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection are required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual materials handling cars) or other activities in which materials or equipment could potentially roll over an employee’s feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection are required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a foot injury. Although there are no specific OSHA requirements for safety footwear for marine engineers, it is nonetheless sensible to select and wear safety shoes based on the hazards found in the engine room.</p>

                  <term>Safety Shoes and Boots.</term> Safety shoes and boots are available in many styles depending on the job requirements. Boots provide more protection than shoes from chemicals and molten metals splashes and spark hazards, but they are heavier. Some protective features that are available in both boots and shoes include: <ul>
                     <li>Oil resistant shoes </li>

               <p>
                  <term>Composite-Toe Safety Shoes</term> Composite-toe shoes have a protective cap made of non-metallic materials such as carbon fiber, Kevlar, or fiberglass. They offer lightweight protection and are ideal for environments where metal detection is required or in situations where electrical conductivity needs to be minimized.</p>
               <p>
                  <term>Electrically Insulated Safety Shoes</term> These shoes have non-conductive soles to prevent the wearer’s feet from completing an electrical circuit to ground. They can protect workers against as much as 600 volts in dry conditions. These shoes should be used in conjunction with insulated tools and precautions to reduce or eliminate the potential for providing a path for hazardous electrical energy. Non-conductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations; in such locations, electrically conductive shoes are required. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Electrically Conductive Safety Shoes</term> These shoes protect against the buildup of static electricity. Essentially, these shoes ground the employees wearing them. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on an employee’s body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. During training, employees must be instructed not to use foot powder or wear socks made of silk, wool, or nylon with conductive shoes. Foot powder insulates and retards the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool, and nylon produce static electricity. Conductive shoes are not general-purpose shoes and must be removed upon completion of the tasks for which they are required. Employees exposed to electrical hazards must <em>never</em> wear conductive shoes. </p>

            <p>Electricity is the backbone of modern civilization, supporting nearly every aspect of our lives.  Most people have used electricity every day of their lives without giving it much thought.  Electricity is not a single thing, rather the term encompasses a broad range of phenomena associated with the presence and movement of charged particles. Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. </p>
            <p>Electrical phenomena include static electricity, electrical discharges like lightning and sparks, electromagnetic waves like light and x-rays, electromagnitism, electrical generation by induction, chemical reaction, and photoelectric effects; power transmission through conductors, resistance heating, conversion of electrical power to motion, and more. </p>
            <p>In this chapter we will define some basic electrical concepts and describe some important electrical devices in order to give you a framework to understand how we harness and use electrical power aboard the training ship.</p>

            <title>Fundamental Concepts</title>
            <introduction>
               <p>Electricity is associated with the accumulation or the flow of <term>charged particles</term>, particularly <term>electrons</term>, which are negatively-charged, subatomic particles. Charged particles will naturally flow from areas of high concentration to low concentration if a conductive path is available. The conductor is usually solid, like a copper wire, but can also be liquids such as salt water and mercury, or ionized gasses. </p>
               <p>Static electricity is caused by the accumulation of electrons, as might occur from rubbing hard rubber on a wool carpet. The resulting static charge  can be released suddenly as a spark when you touch a metal object. During a thunderstorm, large quantities of charged particles build up in the clouds and are eventually released to the earth as lightning through ionized air. </p>
               <p>In practical devices, the charged particles are made to flow in a controlled fashion through an <term>electrical circuit</term> to supply power to <term>electrical loads</term>, such as lights, motors, heating elements, electronic devices, etc.  This flow of charged particles is called <term>electrical current</term>.</p>
               <p>Current can be initiated and sustained in a number of ways, including<ul>

                        <term>Photovoltaic effect.</term>   When sunlight strikes the surface of a solar cell, photons are absorbed by the semiconductor material used in the cell which causes some electrons  break free from their normal positions, creating a charge imbalance.</li>

                        <term>Seebeck effect</term>. The Seebeck effect is a phenomenon where a  small current is produced between two different types of metals or semiconductor materials when  a temperature difference exists between them.  Thermocouples use this principle to produce electric signals for temperature measurement.</li>

               <p>Electrical <term>charge</term> is a fundamental property of matter that gives rise to the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces in nature. It is the property that describes the interaction between particles due to their electric fields.

                  <term>Current</term> refers to the flow of electric charge in an electrical circuit. It is the rate at which electric charges, typically electrons, move through a <term>conductor</term>. Electrons, which are negatively charged particles, are the primary carriers of electric charge in most conductive materials.</p>

                     <p>Current is measured in amperes (A) and is represented by the symbol I. It can be thought of as the quantity of charge passing through a point in a circuit per unit of time, or alternately as the rate of charge flow. </p>
                     <p>The <term>ampere</term>, or <term>amp</term> (unit symbol: A) is the unit of electrical current.  One ampere is equal to one coulomb of charge moving past a point in one second.</p>

               <p>Consider the battery shown in <xref ref="fig_battery"/>.  The chemical reaction inside the battery causes electrons to move from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, making the negative terminal more negative and the positive terminal more positive.  This creates a <term>potential difference</term>, or <term>voltage</term> across the battery terminals.  </p>
               <p>When the switch is closed, excess electrons will naturally be attracted to the positive terminal and they will migrate through the wire  to attempt to equalize the charge.  This create a flow of electrons that will continue until the chemical reaction is depleted and the battery <q>dies</q>.</p>

               <p>Whenever a potential difference exists between two points in a circuit, whether created by a battery, a generator, or some other voltage source, it will drive electrons from the more negative point towards the more positively point.  This is called <term>electron flow</term>, or <term>electron current</term>.</p>
               <p>Sadly, electron current is not technically <term>current</term>! This is because, in 1752, before the nature of electric charge and electrons was fully understood,  Benjamin Franklin <em>defined</em> current as a stream of charge that flows from a more positively charged area to a more negatively charged area (less positive). That is, the direction of current is defined exactly opposite to the electron flow. This convention was adopted because it is easier to think of a flow going from a higher level (more positive) to a lower level (less positive), like water flowing down hill. </p>
               <p>This definition of current, sometimes called <term>conventional current</term> for clarity, is the one used by physicists, engineers, and in textbooks.  You should think of current as positive charge flowing from a positive terminal to a negative terminal, even though, in reality, negatively charged electrons flow in the other direction.</p>

               <p>
                  <term>Voltage</term>, is a fundamental concept in electricity.  In simple terms, voltage serves as the driving <q>push</q> or <q>force</q> that propels electric charges through a circuit. Other terms used for voltage include <term>electromotive force</term> (EMF), or <term>electric potential difference</term>.   In electrical formulas and equations, you will see voltage symbolized with a capital <m>E</m> or <m>V</m> for steady or average values, or with an <m>e</m> or <m>v</m> for time varying values.</p>
               <definition>
                  <statement>
                     <p>The <term>volt</term> (unit symbol: V) is the unit of electromotive force in the International System of Units.  An electric potential difference of one volt between two points will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge moving between them.  Another, more practical, definition of a volt is the potential difference required to drive one amp of current through one ohm of resistance. </p>
                  </statement>
               </definition>
               <p>Voltage in an electrical system is equivalent to pressure in a fluid system, and just as a pump generates fluid pressure, voltage must be generated somehow.  There are several methods to produce a voltage, including <em>chemical reactions</em> (such as in batteries) and the <em>photovoltaic effect</em> (as in solar cells); however, the most important method is <term>electromagnetic induction</term>.  Electromagnetic induction is the process where a changing magnetic field induces (creates) an electric voltage in a nearby conductor.   This phenomenon is the basis for generating electricity in devices like generators and transformers and it will be described in more detail in <xref ref="topic-faradays-law"/>.</p>
               <p>A voltage source (power supply) such as a battery or generator is connected to the attached circuit at two points called the <term>terminals</term>. The voltage between the terminals will drive current flow from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.  The term <term>polarity</term> in typically refers to the orientation of the terminals. In simple terms, it indicates which terminal is positive and which is negative with respect to some reference point.</p>

               <title>Sine Waves</title>
               <p>Electrical systems may be described as either <term>DC</term> (direct current) or <term>AC</term> (alternating current) depending on the voltage supply.  </p>
               <p>In DC systems, the power supply maintains a constant polarity, <ie/> one terminal is always positive, and the other is always negative, and the supply voltage is usually fairly steady.  Batteries and solar cells are examples of DC voltage sources.  In DC circuits, current always flows around the circuit in exactly one direction, from the positive to the negative terminal. <xref ref="fig_battery"/> is a simple example of a DC system. The current flows from the positive terminal of the battery, through the bulb, the switch, and then returns to the negative terminal of the battery.  </p>
               <p>On the other hand, in AC systems the polarity of the voltage switches periodically in a repeating pattern.  This causes the current in the circuit to change periodically as well.  In this section we discuss some important properties of period waves</p>
               <paragraphs>
                  <title>Periodic Waves</title>
                  <p>A periodic waveform is a quantity, (voltage, current, power, for example) that varies in a repeating pattern over time.  Standard AC voltage takes the form of a sine wave as shown in <xref ref="fig_sine-wave-definitions"/>, although other shapes such as square waves and sawtooth waves are used in electronic circuits.</p>
                  <p>Periodic waveforms are characterized by several key properties that define its behavior and shape:</p>
                  <figure xml:id="fig_sine-wave-definitions">

                  </figure>
                  <p>
                     <term>Amplitude</term> (Peak value): The amplitude is the maximum value reached by the waveform during each cycle. It represents the highest positive or negative value from the reference level (usually zero volts).</p>
                  <p>
                     <term>Frequency</term> The frequency <m>f</m> of a periodic waveform is the number of complete cycles or oscillations that occur in one second. It is measured in Hertz (Hz). Frequency determines how quickly the voltage waveform repeats itself.  Standard electrical voltage in the United States is generated at 60 Hz, while 50 Hz is used in Europe and Japan.</p>
                  <p>
                     <term>Period</term> The period <m>T</m> of a periodic wave is the time it takes for one complete cycle to occur. It is the reciprocal of frequency (<m>T = 1 / f</m>) and is measured in seconds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <term>Peak-to-Peak Value</term> The peak-to-peak value is the difference between the maximum positive and maximum negative values in a waveform. It represents the total range of voltage variation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <term>Root Mean Square (RMS) Voltage</term> The <term/>root mean square is a mathematical concept used to represent the <em>effective</em> or <em>average</em> value of a varying quantity, such as voltage or current, in an AC waveform. It provides a way to express the magnitude of an AC signal in a manner that is equivalent to the magnitude of a DC value. </p>
                  <p>RMS values, rather than peak or instantaneous values, are used to describe the properties of AC systems.   For example, when you see the voltage rating on a household electrical device (e.g., 120V for North America), it's the RMS value that's being specified. Similarly, the current rating (e.g., 15A) refers to the RMS value of the current.</p>
                  <p>For a sinusoidal waveform (like the standard AC power supply waveform), the RMS value is approximately <m>1/\sqrt{2} =  0.707</m> times the peak value of the waveform.  <me>V_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{V_{\text{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad V_{\text{peak}} =V_{\text{RMS}}\sqrt{2}</me>
                  </p>
                  <p>The RMS value of an AC voltage is the equivalent steady DC voltage that would produce the same amount of power dissipation across a resistor as the AC voltage across the same resistor. In other words, it's the voltage that gives the same heating effect as the AC voltage. Similarly, the RMS value of an AC current is the equivalent steady DC current that would produce the same power dissipation in a resistor as the AC current through the same resistor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <term>Phase Shift</term> Phase shift refers to the time difference between two periodic waveforms. It's often expressed in degrees and indicates how far one waveform is shifted in time relative to another. A phase shift of 0 degrees means the waveforms are in sync, while a phase shift of 180 degrees means they are completely out of phase.  Recall that capacitors and inductors cause a phase shift between current and voltage.</p>

            <subsection xml:id="electricity-reactance">
               <title>Reactance</title>
               <p>
                  <term>Reactance</term> is a property that represents opposition to current flow in AC systems due to reactive components like <term>capacitors</term> and <term>inductors</term>. Unlike resistance, which is related to the dissipation of energy as heat, reactance is associated with the storage and release of energy in the electric or magnetic fields of the reactive components.</p>
               <p>There are two types of reactance:</p>
               <p>
                  <term>Capacitive Reactance</term>
                  <m>X_C</m>: Capacitive reactance occurs in circuits containing capacitors. When AC voltage is applied to a capacitor, it causes a displacement of charge between the plates, resulting in the accumulation and discharge of energy. This leads to a phase shift between the voltage and current waveforms. Capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to the frequency of the AC signal so is less significant at high frequencies. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Inductive Reactance</term>
                  <m>X_L</m>: Inductive reactance arises in circuits containing inductors. When AC voltage is applied to an inductor, it induces a magnetic field that stores energy. Changes in the magnetic field cause an opposing voltage that leads to a phase shift between voltage and current. Inductive reactance is directly proportional to the frequency of the AC signal so is less significant at low frequencies.</p>
               <p>Reactance is measured in ohms (<m>\Omega</m>), just like resistance. However, reactance has both magnitude and phase, making it a complex quantity. The magnitude of reactance determines how much opposition a reactive component offers to the AC current, while the phase shift characterizes the timing difference between the voltage and current waveforms.</p>
               <p>
                  <term>Impedance</term>
                  <m>Z</m>: is a measure of the total opposition to flow of current in an AC circuit due to both resistance and reactance.<me> Z = \sqrt{R^2+ (X_L -X_C)^2} </me>.  Impedance has units of ohms.</p>
               <p>
                  <term>Phase shift</term>:  In a circuit with no reactive elements, the current and voltage sine waves are in phase, <ie/>  their peaks and valleys line up.  However reactive elements cause the current and voltage waves to shift out of phase.  An inductor will cause the current to <term>lag</term> behind the voltage, while a capacitor will cause the current to <term>lead</term> the voltage. </p>

                  <p>The first issue is solved by using RMS average values for current, voltage and power, however simply applying <xref ref="PEI"/> and multiplying the RMS voltage by the RMS current does not give the correct RMS power because of the second issue, the phase shift between the current and voltage waveforms.</p>

               <p>
                  <term>Ohm’s law</term> describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance in an electric circuit. According to Ohm's Law, the current flowing through a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage across it and inversely proportional to the resistance of the circuit. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as <men xml:id="ohms-law">I = V/R</men>  where: <ul marker="">
                     <li>
                        <m>I</m> is the the current in amperes</li>
                     <li>
                        <m>V</m> is the voltage in volts, and </li>
                     <li>
                        <m>R</m> is the resistance in ohms (<m>\Omega</m>). </li>
                  </ul>
               </p>
               <p>In other words, an increase in voltage leads to a corresponding increase in current if the resistance remains constant, while an increase in resistance results in a decrease in current for a given voltage.</p>
               <p>It's important to note that Ohm's Law is most applicable to linear resistors under constant conditions. In AC circuits with reactive components like capacitors and inductors, Ohm's Law needs to be extended to include the concept of impedance, which takes into account both resistance and reactance.</p>

               <title>Faraday's Law</title>
               <p>Electromagnetic induction was discovered by English scientist Michael Faraday in 1831. It is not an exaggeration to say that this discovery is the foundation of the modern world. </p>
               <p>Faraday observed that a <em>changing</em> magnetic field induces an EMF in a nearby conductor.  You can observe this yourself by moving a magnet around and through a coil of wire connected to a sensitive voltmeter.  When the magnetic field passing through the coil changes, whether by moving the magnet through the coil, by moving the conductor through the field, or by varying the strength of the field, a voltage is induced in the conductor that can be used to drive current and deliver electrical power. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction</term> states that the induced EMF in a closed coil is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux passing through the circuit. Mathematically, it is expressed as: <men xml:id="faradays-law">\text{EMF} = - n \frac{d\Phi}{dt} </men> Where: <ul marker="">
                     <li>EMF is the induced electromotive force (in volts)</li>
                     <li>
                        <m>n</m> is the number of turns in the coil</li>
                     <li>
                        <m>\dfrac{d\Phi}{dt}</m> is the rate of change in magnetic flux (in webers/sec)</li>
                  </ul>
               </p>
               <p>The opposite is also true.  When an electric current flows through a conductor, it generates a magnetic field that surrounds the conductor.  This phenomenon is called <term>Oersted’s principle</term>, and it is principle behind motors, solenoids, and electromagnets.</p>
               <p>The experiment setup in <xref ref="fig_faradays_experiment"/> demonstrates both Faraday’s Law and Oersted’s Principle.  </p>

               <p>Two coils are wrapped around opposite sides of an iron ring. The left coil is connected to a battery and a switch.  The right coil is connected to a galvanometer, which is an instrument that detects small voltages.  </p>
               <p>When the switch is closed,  current flowing in the left coil produces a magnetic field surrounding the conductor (Oersted’s principle).  This field is trapped and channeled through the right hand coil by the iron ring.  As the field builds up when the switch is closed, or collapses when the switch is opened, a voltage is detected on the galvanometer (Faraday’s Law).  However, If the switch is left in either position for very long, the voltage decays to zero, and remains that way until the switch is once again flipped.  This indicates the the induced voltage is caused by a <em>changing</em> magnetic flux <m>\dfrac{d\Phi}{dt}</m>and not by the flux alone.</p>

               <p>
                  <term>Ground</term> in electricity has several meanings depending on the context in which it's used. Ground primarily means the earth when ashore, or the hull aboard ship.   </p>
               <p>Circuits are <term>grounded</term> by connecting them to ground. This <term>ground connection</term> provides an alternate path for electrical currents to flow back to the source. Ashore, electrical circuits are grounded by connecting them electrically to a rod or pipe driven into the earth, while aboard ship, a connection the hull serves the same purpose.    A <term>chassis ground</term>, refers to the point on the metal frame or outer casing (chassis) of an electrical or electronic device where the circuit is grounded.  The chassis itself is grounded to the earth or the hull. Ground also refers to a reference point used for voltage measurements.  Finally a ground or <term>ground fault</term> can refer to an accidental connection between the circuit and ground </p>
               <p>The ground connection serves several important functions:  <ul>
                     <li>
                        <term>Reference Point</term> Voltage is always measured relative to a reference point. By defining a specific point as "ground," voltages at other points in the circuit are measured with respect to this reference.  </li>
                     <li>
                        <term>Safety Grounding</term> is crucial for safety in electrical systems. In case of a fault or short circuit, excess current can flow to the ground, allowing circuit protection devices like fuses and circuit breakers to quickly interrupt the current flow. This helps prevent electrical fires, shocks, and damage to equipment.</li>
                     <li>
                        <term>Human Safety</term> In the event of a fault that causes a live conductor to come into contact with a conductive surface (like a metal enclosure), the ground connection provides an alternate path for current to flow <em>around</em>, rather than <em>through</em> the victim, reducing the severity of electric shock.</li>
                     <li>
                        <term>Shielding</term> In electronic devices and systems, grounding is used for shielding against electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). Metal enclosures and components can be connected to the ground to create a shield that prevents external electromagnetic signals from interfering with the device's operation.</li>

               <p>Conductors are materials that provide a pathway to connect the various components within the circuit, allowing the current to flow from the power source to the load.</p>
               <p>Good conductors are materials that have low resistance because their electrons are loosely bound to their atoms.  Copper, aluminum, silver, and gold, are all good conductors. </p>

               <p>Three methods are commonly used to describe the size of wires and electrical conductors. </p>
               <p>The <term>American Wire Gage</term> (AWG) system assigns a specific number to each wire size, with lower numbers representing larger wires. The system is widely used in the United States for copper and  aluminum wires. For example, a common household electrical wire might be designated as <em>12 AWG</em> or <em>14 AWG</em>. Smaller numbers indicate thicker wires with larger cross-sectional area, capable of carrying higher current loads. Larger numbers represents thinner wires.</p>
               <p>The <term>Metric system</term> simply uses the cross-sectional area of the wire measured in square millimeters (<m>\text{mm}^2</m>). For instance, you might see a wire labeled as <m>2.5 \text{ mm}^2</m> or <m>4.0 \text{ mm}^2</m>. A larger number indicates a larger cross-sectional area and, therefore, a thicker wire capable of carrying more current.</p>
               <p>
                  <term>Circular mils.</term> This system is used in the United States when discussing very small or very large wire sizes. The term <em>circular mil</em> is often abbreviated as <em>CM</em>. The circular mil is defined as the area of a circle with a diameter of one mil, where one mil is a unit of length equal to one thousandth of an inch (0.001 inch).</p>
               <p>Mathematically, the formula for calculating the circular mil area, <m>A</m>, of a wire with diameter, <m>d</m>, in mils is <me>A = \frac{d^2}{4} \text{ circular mils}</me>.</p>
               <p>For example, if you have a wire with a diameter of 500 mils, you can calculate its circular mil area as follows: <me>A = \frac{500^2}{4} = 125,000 \text{ circular mils}</me>

               <title>Capacitors</title>
               <p>A capacitor is an electrical component that stores and releases electrical energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a <term>dielectric</term>. When a voltage is applied across the plates, electric charges accumulate on the plates, creating an electric field between them.</p>
               <p>When a capacitor is charged in this way, energy is stored in the electric field.  Capacitors can be discharged to quickly provide short bursts of power.  They are often used for energy storage, filtering, and smoothing voltage fluctuations.</p>

               <p>A <term>transistor</term> is a semiconductor device that acts as an electronic switch or amplifier. It can control the flow of electric current between its two main terminals, known as the collector and emitter, by using a small current at its third terminal, called the base.  Transistors are used for amplification and switching purposes.and are the building blocks of modern electronics.</p>
               <p>The most common variety of transistor is the <term>bipolar junction transistor</term> (BJT), which has two variations: <term>NPN</term> and <term>PNP</term>.  In an NPN transistor, current flows from the emitter to the collector when a small current is applied to the base. A PNP transistor is the opposite of an NPN transistor.  In a PNP transistor, current flows from the collector to the emitter when a small current is applied to the base.</p>

               <p>
                  <term>Circuit breakers</term> are electromechanical devices that to swiftly interrupt current flow under short circuit and overload conditions.</p>
               <p>Short circuits protection is provided by the <term>instantaneous trip mechanism</term>. It relies on the electromagnetic force generated by the excessive current passing through a solenoid coil. The large magnetic field generated by the high current causes the solenoid to rapidly trigger a trip mechanism and open the circuit breaker's contacts almost instantly. </p>
               <p>The <term>overload trip mechanism</term> detects sustained high currents caused by excessive load or faulty equipment, but permits the temporary overloads that occur when a motor starts. The load current passes through a bimetallic strip or a heating element. If the current increases, the temperature of the bimetallic strip rises, causing it to bend. When the bending reaches a critical point, it triggers the trip mechanism, opening the circuit breaker contacts and cutting off the current.</p>
               <p>
                  <term>Fuses</term>  are thin wires or elements designed to melt and break the circuit when excessive current flows through them. Like circuit breakers, they provide protection against overcurrents and short circuits but need to be replaced after they "blow."</p>
               <p>
                  <term>Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters</term> (GFCIs) monitor current imbalances, swiftly shutting off power if a ground fault is detected, protecting against electric shocks.</p>

               <title>Circuit Faults</title>
               <p>Circuit faults or malfunctions can usually be grouped into one of the following categories:</p>
               <p>An <term>open circuit</term> occurs when the conducting path has been broken, intentionally or unintentionally, stopping the flow of current. An open occurs when a switch is opened, a fuse blows or a circuit breaker trips, or when a wire breaks or becomes disconnected.  The resistance of an open circuit is effectively infinite.</p>
               <p>A <term>short circuit</term> is an unintentional low-resistance pathway between two points at different voltage levels.  Shorts can occur between two points in the same circuit, or between a single point and ground. </p>
               <p>By Ohm’s law, when the resistance is small the resulting current will be large. Large short circuit currents can lead to overheating, damage, fire hazards or arc flash. Electric shock may be caused by a short circuit through the human body.</p>
               <p>In a properly protected circuit, a circuit breaker or fuse should quickly open to interrupt the short circuit current.</p>
               <p>Short circuits can are caused by faulty or incorrect wiring, insulation failure, and particularly by human error.</p>
               <p>A <term>ground fault</term> occurs when an electric circuit is unintentionally connected to the earth or to the ship's hull. This connection allows current to return to the source through an unintended path.</p>
               <p>Ground faults are caused by insulation failure due to age, abrasion, or abuse, and especially due to moisture, either from the humidity in the air or by direct impingement. Salt water infiltration common cause of ground faults in deck equipment.  When a person accidentally comes in contact with a live wire and ground at the same time, the resulting shock is actually a ground fault.</p>
               <p>Aboard ship, we continuously monitor for ground faults using <term>ground lamps</term> and <term>ground ammeters</term>.  When a ground fault is detected the ship’s engineers repair them as soon as possible to prevent bigger problems such as equipment failure.</p>

               <p>Ground faults are different than short circuits because the ground fault current is usually too small to trip a circuit breaker or blow a fuse.  Ground fault circuit interrupters, like those found in your bathroom at home, are designed to detect these small ground currents and quickly open to prevent electrical shock.</p>

                     <p>A <term>digital multimeter</term> (DMM) is a versatile electronic tool that combines multiple measurement functions in one device. Most digital multimeters can measure AC and DC voltages, AC and DC currents up to a few amps, resistance, and perform continuity tests.  Some meters can additionally measure capacitance, frequency, check diodes, and measure temperatures with an optional thermocouple. A good digital multimeter is a valuable tool for troubleshooting electrical and electronic devices.  </p>

                  <p>When using a DMM, always ensure that the test leads are correctly connected to the meter; the black lead goes in the common (COM) jack, but the red lead position depends on the measurement you intend to make. Next, select the desired measurement mode with a selector switch to configure the DMM's internal circuitry, and finally connect the test leads to the circuit and make the measurement.   The DMM displays the measured values on a digital screen, showing the numerical value and unit. Some models have auto-ranging, which selects the appropriate measurement range automatically, and data hold functions to freeze the displayed value.</p>
                  <p>To measure voltage you connect the DMM probes to the circuit across two points of interest.  An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) detects the voltage difference between them and converts it into a digital format which is then processed and displayed. When measuring large voltages, a potential divider circuit proportionally reduces the voltage to a suitable lower value. </p>
                  <p>To measure current, the DMM is connected in series with the circuit under test and the voltage drop across a precision internal resistor is measured to determine the current.   However, to use a DMM to measure current you must disconnect and open a portion of the circuit to introduce the meter.  For this reason, DMMs are rarely used for current measurement.</p>
                  <p>Resistance measurement involves applying a stabilized voltage from the meter’s battery to the component being tested and measuring the resulting current. Using the applied voltage and measured current, the DMM calculates the resistance.</p>
                  <p>A continuity test is just a resistance measurement used to determine if two points are electrically connected.  Often the meter will produce an audible <q>beep</q> if the resistance is below a threshold value of 50-100 ohms.</p>

                        <term>Clamp-on ammeters</term> are hand-held instruments used to measure AC currents. A plier-like pick-up coil is closed around the conductor in which current is to be measured, and the movement responds to current induced in the pick-up coil by the changing magnetic field surrounding the conductor.  Clamp-on meters are preferable to digital multimeters for measuring currents because the don’t require the circuit to be disturbed to use, and they can measure larger currents than a DMM, however, because they depend on a changing magnetic field they do not work with DC currents.</p>

               <p>Batteries are electro-chemical, direct-current power supplies.  Batteries store and deliver electrical energy through a chemical reaction. Batteries consist of several electro-chemical <term>cells</term>, each containing an <term>anode</term>, <term>cathode</term>, and <term>electrolyte</term>. </p>
               <p>When connected to a circuit, the anode releases electrons into the external circuit, while the cathode absorbs them, generating an electrical current.  Each cell creates around 1.5 volts depending on the battery chemistry.</p>
               <p>The chemical energy stored in a battery is finite, and is measured as its <term>ampere-hour capacity</term>. As current is drawn from the battery the chemical energy is depleted, at which time the battery must be replaced or when possible, recharged.  </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Wet cell</term> batteries contain a <em>liquid</em> electrolyte that is typically a mixture of water and sulfuric acid.  <term>Lead-acid</term> batteries are the most common type of wet cell. Wet-cell batteries are used where large power capacity is required, such as for uninterruptible power supplies and for starting small engines. </p>
               <p>
                  <term>Dry cell</term> batteries contain an electrolyte in a solid, semi-solid, or gel-like state.  <term>Alkaline</term>, <term>nickel-cadmium</term> (Nicad), <term>lithium-ion</term>, and <term>nickel-metal hydride</term> batteries are all dry cells. Dry cells are commonly used for low-power purposes, such as flashlights and portable equipment.</p>
               <p>The state of charge of a battery usually cannot be determined easily or accurately. For lead-acid batteries the approximate charge is determined by measuring the density of the electrolyte with a hydrometer, while the approximate charge of the Nicad batteries is determined by measuring the cell voltage.</p>

               <p>According to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, a moving or changing magnetic field induces an electric voltage in a nearby conductor. If the conductor forms a closed loop, an electric current will flow and electrical power will be transmitted.</p>
               <p>An electrical generator consists of two main <em>mechanical</em> components: a rotating part called the <term>rotor</term> and a stationary part called the <term>stator</term>, and two main <em>electrical</em> components: the <term>armature</term> and the <term>field</term>.  </p>
               <p>Both the armature and the field are made of a conducting material, usually copper wire, wound into multi-loop coils called <term>windings</term>. The rotor is connected to a prime mover, such as a steam turbine or a diesel engine which supplies the mechanical energy to the generator.</p>
               <p>The <term>field windings</term> are like an electromagnet.  When direct current (DC) flows through the field windings, a magnetic field is created similar to the one which surrounds the north and south poles of an ordinary magnet, but adjustable. The strength of the field is controlled by the amount of the field current.  The process of supplying electrical current to the field winding is known as <term>excitation</term>.  </p>
               <p>The <term>armature windings</term> are the part of the generator where the voltage is induced.  The armature consists of several individual windings connected in a specific configuration. The end points of the armature windings are called the generator <term>terminals</term>.  As long as the generator is spinning, the field will induce a sinusoidal AC voltage into the armature windings.  The armature windings deliver power to the terminals and thence to the load circuit.</p>
               <p>In a typical AC synchronous generator, the rotor carries the field windings and the stator carries the armature windings, however the opposite arrangement is also possible.</p>

                  <p>The diagram below shows a simplified AC, single-phase synchronous generator, illustrating the rotor, stator, armature and field. </p>
                  <p>A prime mover such as an engine or turbine spins the rotor and supplies the input mechanical energy.  The rotor carries an externally energized electromagnet (the field) which creates a magnetic field.  The rotor is surrounded by the stator, which carries multiple turns of copper windings, (the stationary armature).   The ends of the armature windings are the generator terminals; the external circuit begins and ends there.</p>

                  <p>As the rotating magnetic field passes by the stationary armature, a voltage is induced in the armature.  This voltage varies in magnitude and direction sinusoidally, as shown in <xref ref="fig_sine-wave-definitions"/>.</p>
                  <p>The frequency is related to the rotor rpm according to this relation: <me>f =   \frac{120 \times N}{2 \times 60}</me> where f is the frequency in Hz and N is the total number of poles.   </p>
                  <p>For a two-pole field (one north and one south pole) rotating at 3600 rpm, the voltage will alternate through 60 cycles each second <ie/> 360 Hz. With a four-pole field, the north and south poles will pass by the armature windings twice per rotation. As a result, a four-pole generator will produce the same frequency as a two-pole generator while spinning at half the speed.  </p>
                  <p>Although the voltage continuously varies from instant to instant, we represent the sine wave voltage using its RMS average.The RMS voltage is proportional to the speed of rotation and also the strength of the magnetic field, therefore the generator output voltage can be adjusted by controlling the current that creates the field. </p>

               <p>Induction motors have many advantages over other designs.  First they are simple, rugged, reliable and require very little maintenance.  Induction motors are relatively cost-effective to manufacture, and are widely available in a broad size range, for all common single and three-phase voltages.

Modern designs and technologies, such as variable frequency drives (VFDs), contribute to improved efficiency allow precise control of motor speed and performance.</p>

               <p>As the rotating magnetic field passes over the rotor windings, it induces a voltage, according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This voltage drives a current through the rotor windings, which, in turn, generates a magnetic field surrounding the rotor windings.</p>
               <p>The magnetic field of the rotor interacts with the rotating magnetic field of the stator and magnetic attraction pulls the rotor in the same direction as the rotating magnetic field. As the rotor rotates, it tries to catch up with the rotating magnetic field. </p>
               <p>However, the mechanical load on the motor retards the shaft, so the rotor  speed <m>n</m>, always remains slightly less than the synchronous speed, <m>n_s</m>.  The difference between the synchronous speed and the actual </p>
               <p>operating speed is called <term>slip</term>, often expressed as a percentage of the synchronous speed <me>\textrm{\% slip}= \left(\frac{n_s-n}{n_s}\right) \times 100\%</me>.</p>
               <p>The difference in speed between the rotating magnetic field and the rotor's rotational speed induces the current, torque, and power that drives the load connected to the motor shaft.   Slip is required for the motor to generate torque and perform useful work.</p>
               <p>The mechanical power produced by a motor can be calculated using the formula:<me>P  = \tau \omega</me> Where: <ul marker="">
                     <li>
                        <m>P</m> is the shaft power in Watt (W). </li>
                     <li>
                        <m>\tau</m> is torque or twisting force generated by the motor, measured in Newton-meters (Nm).</li>
                     <li>
                        <m>\omega</m> is the angular velocity of the motor in radians per second (rad/s).  Angular velocity is equal to the shaft rpm <m>\times \frac{2\pi}{60}.</m>

                  </ul>
               </p>
               <p>In practical applications, mechanical power can also be expressed in other units such as kilowatts (kW), Horsepower (HP),  or foot-pounds per minute (ft-lb/min).</p>
               <p>An increase in load on the motor causes the shaft to slow down slightly, which increases both slip and torque.  The power output of the motor automatically adjusts to match the requirements of the load.</p>
               <p>Although the motor always has some slip, the rotor speed is generally close to the synchronous speed.  For a motor with a fixed number of poles, the rotor speed can be changed by changing the frequency of the power supply with a variable speed drive or a frequency converter. </p>
               <p>Although most large motors aboard ship are supplied with three-phase power, smaller motors, such as those driving appliances, must operate from single-phase circuits.   <term>Single-phase motors</term> are most often arranged with two sets of stator windings, with the second set supplied from the line connections through a <term>capacitor</term>. The capacitor imposes a phase shift on the line current reaching these windings, to make it look like two-phase AC current. The stator is thus able to develop a rotating magnetic field to drive a rotor.</p>

               <title>Variable Frequency Drives</title>
               <p>A <term>Variable Frequency Drive</term> (VFD) is an electronic device used to control the speed and direction of an electric motor by adjusting the frequency and voltage of the power supplied to the motor. VFDs are commonly used in industrial and commercial applications to achieve energy efficiency, process control, and improved motor performance.</p>
               <p>A basic variable frequency drive has three main components: <ol>
                     <li>
                        <p>The <term>Diode Front End</term>  which takes in an AC power supply from the mains and converts it into DC power using a three-phase rectifier. </p>

                        <p>The <term>DC Capacitor</term>  The rectified power is stored in a large capacitor, which acts as a buffer to provide a stable DC voltage to the DC Bus.</p>

                        <p>The <term>Inverter</term> The inverter is responsible for converting the DC power back into AC power with variable voltage and frequency. This stage utilizes power electronic devices, such as <term>insulated gate bipolar transistors</term> (<term>IGBTs</term>), to switch the DC voltage in a controlled manner. </p>
                        <p>To synthesize the desired AC waveform, the VFD uses a technique called <term>Pulse Width Modulation</term> (<term>PWM</term>). PWM involves rapidly switching the IGBTs on and off to create a series of voltage pulses with varying widths. By adjusting the width of these pulses, the VFD can control the effective voltage and frequency of the output AC waveform.</p>

                  <p>
                     <term>Pulse Width Modulation</term> (<term>PWM</term>) is a technique used in electronics to control the average value of a signal.  PWM works by rapidly turning a signal (usually a square wave) on and off. The overall effect is that the signal appears to have varying average voltage or power, depending on the width of the <em>on</em> or <em>high</em> portion of the signal.</p>
                  <p>The <term>duty cycle</term> is a parameter of PWM that represents the percentage of time the signal is on or at a high level compared to the <term>period</term>
                     <mdash/> the time to complete one cycle. It determines the average value of the signal. A duty cycle of 50% means the signal is on for half the time and off for the other half, resulting in an average voltage or power that is halfway between the high and low levels. By changing the duty cycle, the average value of the signal can be controlled. Increasing the duty cycle increases the average value, while decreasing the duty cycle decreases the average value.</p>

               <p>Motor controllers come in various types and forms, ranging from simple relay-based control systems to complex microcontroller-based systems. The choice of motor controller depends on factors such as the specific application requirements, the types of motors being used, and the desired levels of control sophistication.</p>
               <p>Motor controllers usually provide three basic functions: starting, stopping, and motor protection.  The controller monitors the motor circuit and will secure the motor if it detects common faults such as overload, short circuits, or low voltage conditions.  </p>
               <p>Additional functions such as direction control, speed control, regenerative braking, and reduced voltage (soft) starting, can be added to the control circuitry when required by the application.  Many modern motor controllers also provide diagnostic information and feedback about motor performances, temperatures, and statuses.  This information helps with troubleshooting and preventive maintenance.</p>
               <p>Next, we will describe the operation of one simple and common motor controller: an <term>across-the-line</term> starter.  It is given this name because the controller connects the motor’s stator windings directly across the power lines and starts it using full line voltage. This type of motor controller is very common, and is worth studying as its basic control circuit is the foundation of many other devices.</p>
               <p>The power and control circuits for an across-the-line starter are shown in <xref ref="fig_motor_controller"/>. The circuit consists of two parts: the three-phase power circuit (blue) , which connects the power supply, entering from the left, to the motor, and the single-phase control circuit (black) which is responsible for the control functions. </p>
               <p>The power circuit consists of a circuit breaker (1), three main contacts (2),  three overload sensors (3), and connections to the motor (4). The control circuit consists of two control fuses (5), start (6) and stop (7) buttons, a latching relay, (8), the contactor operating coil (9), and normally closed overload relay contacts (10).</p>

                     <li>The <term>main operating coil</term> is part of the <term>contactor</term> assembly<fn>The contactor assembly consists of the coil (9), and contacts (2), and (8).  When the coil is de-energized, the contacts are held open by a spring.  When it is energized, the coil closes the contacts electromagnetically. </fn>. When the main operating coil energizes it closes three <term>main contacts</term>    in the power circuit and the <term>auxiliary contact</term> in the control circuit. </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Closing the main contacts completes the circuit between the power supply and the motor, allowing current to flow directly to the motor's terminals and start the motor.</p>
                        <p>Since the auxiliary contact is  wired in parallel with the start button, after it closes the start button may be released and the motor will continue to operate.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>The motor will continue to run until one of the following happens:<ul>
                              <li>The <term>stop button</term> is pressed.  This breaks the control circuit and de-energizes the main coil.  This causes the main and auxiliary contacts to open and stop the motor.</li>
                              <li>One of the three <term>overload sensors</term> detects the motor drawing high current.  This opens the corresponding <term>overload contact</term> in the control circuit and stops the motor.</li>
                              <li>A <term>short circuit</term> is detected by the <term>circuit breaker</term>, tripping it.  This secures power to both the power and control circuits and stops the motor.  Fuses will de-energize the control circuit if a short occurs there.</li>
                              <li>A <term>low voltage condition</term> occurs when the supply voltage drops below about 90% of its nominal value.  If this happens, the current through the operating coil decreases, causing its electromagnet to weaken enough to release the main contacts, which stops the motor.  If the voltage returns to normal, the motor will remain stopped until the start button is pressed again.</li>
                           </ul>
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ol>
               </p>
               <p>A motor which does not restart after a power failure is described as having <term>Low Voltage Protection</term> (LVP).  The alternate behavior, where the motor automatically restarts after a power failure is called  <term>Low Voltage Release</term> (LVR).  Critical machinery such as the steering gear and lube oil pumps have LVR, while other machines have LVP.</p>
               <p>Because across-the-line starters provide full voltage to the motor from the start, the motor experiences a high starting current. This initial surge of current is called the <term>inrush current</term>, and it can be several times the motor's full-load operating current.  This problem is more acute for large motors.</p>
               <p>Large starting current has two negative effects. First, the high current in the windings can generate enough heat to damage the motor over time, especially if the driven load accelerates slowly. Second, very high starting current can draw down line voltage sufficiently to cause lights to dim and other equipment being supplied from the same line to malfunction. </p>
               <p>To reduce the starting currents of large motors, several methods are employed. <ul>
                     <li>
                        <term>Wye-delta starters</term> initially connect the motor to the power supply using a wye connection, which provides only 57% of normal voltage.  After a configurable time delay, the connection switches to delta, and full line voltage is available for normal operation. </li>
                     <li>
                        <term>Autotransformer starters</term> operate similarly but can supply more intermediate voltage steps. </li>
                     <li>
                        <term>Soft starters</term> and <term>variable frequency drives</term>, which are electronic devices, gradually increase the voltage, effectively limiting the starting current.</li>
                  </ul>

               <title>Transformers</title>
               <p>A transformer is an electrical device that uses electromagnetic induction to increase (step-up) or decrease (step-down) AC voltages.  Transformers are simple, efficient, have no moving parts, are easily maintained.</p>
               <p>A simple single-phase transformer consists of two wire coils, called the <term>primary</term> and <term>secondary</term> windings, wound around a common <term>magnetic core</term>.  The core is made of laminated soft iron sheets or other materials that have high magnetic permeability, to enhance the magnetic coupling between the windings. An AC source voltage is supplied to the primary winding, and the electrical load is connected to the secondary winding. </p>

               <p>When alternating current flows through the primary winding, it generates an alternating magnetic field in the magnetic core.  This changing magnetic field, in turn, induces a voltage in the secondary winding through electromagnetic induction.  If the secondary winding has more <term>turns</term> than the primary winding, the secondary voltage will be higher than the input voltage and the transformer is referred to as a <term>step-up</term>  transformer. Conversely, if the secondary winding has fewer turns than the primary winding the secondary voltage will be less than the primary voltage, and the transformer is a  <term>step-down</term> transformer. </p>
               <p>A transformer does not add any power to the electrical circuits only changes its form.  Because electrical power is proportional to the product of current and voltage, when the voltage steps up, the current must step down.</p>
               <p>The relationships between the ratios of primary and secondary voltages, currents and turns are as follows: <mdn>
                     <mrow>\frac{V_s}{V_p}\amp= \frac{N_s}{N_p}</mrow>
                     <mrow>\frac{I_s}{I_p}\amp= \frac{N_p}{N_s}</mrow>
                  </mdn>.  Note that when the turns ratio is greater than one, the voltage steps up and the current steps down.</p>
               <p>Beyond voltage transformation, transformers also furnish electrical isolation between primary and secondary circuits, creating physical and electrical separation while maintaining energy transfer.</p>
               <p>Three-phase transformers can be made using three single-phase transformers, with the primary and secondary windings connected in wye or delta depending on the application.</p>

               <p>A <term>solenoid</term> is an electromechanical device that consists of a coil of wire wound around a cylindrical core. When electric current passes through the wire coil, it generates a magnetic field around the coil. This controllable magnetic field is used to produce various effects.</p>

               <p>For example, electromagnetic relays control the switching of electric circuits. When the solenoid coil is energized, it generates a magnetic field that can either attract or repel the movable armature to open or close a contact.  When the coil is de-energized a spring restores the contact to its normal position.</p>

               <title>Electrical Distribution System</title>
               <p>A shipboard electrical distribution system controls and distributes electrical power from the ship’s generators to the electrical consumers around the ship. </p>
               <p>Ships typically use 460 volt, 60 Hz, three-phase AC for major electrical machinery, and 120 volt, 60 Hz, single-phase for lights, receptacles, and small motors.  These are considered Low Voltage (LV) systems, although even 120 volts can be dangerous. </p>
               <p>High voltage (above 1 kV) is used for very large motors, 400 kW or greater, such as propulsion motors, and thrusters. Marine HV systems typically operate at 3.3 kV or 6.6 kV or 11 kV.   </p>
               <p>The advantage of higher voltages is that for a given power, higher voltage means lower current.  (Recall <xref ref="three-phase-PEI"/>) Reduced current means that smaller diameter conductors can be used, the machine will be physically smaller and thus cheaper, and the machine will be more efficient because it will have smaller <m>I^2 R</m> losses.

               <p>An extremely simplified representation of the <em>Patriot State II</em> electrical distribution system is shown in <xref ref="fig_distribution_simplified"/>.  This diagram represents only about half the distribution system and only shows the portion of the system which is supplied from the after engine room.</p>
               <p>The main components of the distribution system are:</p>
               <paragraphs>
                  <title>Power supply</title>
                  <p>The <term>ship’s service generators</term> are the primary source of electrical power for the vessel.</p>
                  <p>There are four ship’s service generators on the training ship; generators one and two are located in the forward engine room, and three and four are located in the after engine room.  Each can supply 443 A of 6.6 kV, three-phase, 60 Hz AC.  The ship’s service generators are discussed in more detail in <xref ref="ships-generators"/>.</p>
                  <p>A backup <term>emergency generator</term> is provided for use in the event of failure of the ship’s service generators or other emergency.  By regulation the emergency generator must be able to start when the ship has a list of up to 22.5 <degree/>, must come on-line automatically within 45 seconds of a power failure, and must supply power for up to 18 hours. </p>
                  <p>On the training ship, a 500 kW emergency generator is located just forward of the stack on the weather deck (05 level).  The capacity of the emergency generator is less than the ship’s service generators, so when operating it can only supply a limited subset of the ship’s equipment.</p>
                  <p>A UPS, or <term>uninterruptible power supply</term>, is a battery-powered system that provides temporary power after a blackout but before the emergency generator comes on line.  UPSs can either supply DC power directly from the batteries, or supply AC by converting the DC battery output to alternating current using an electronic <term>inverter</term>.   UPSs primarily supply power to vital control systems and the emergency light.</p>
                  <p>A 440 V <term>shore power</term> connection is provided to supply electrical power to the ship when alongside or in the shipyard when it would be undesirable to operate the ship’s generators.</p>

                  <title>Switchboards and Load centers</title>
                  <p>A <term>switchboard</term> is an electrical enclosure containing the equipment that monitors, controls, protects, and distributes electrical power. It divides the electrical system into separate circuits and provides a central point from which electrical power can be managed and routed to different areas or equipment.</p>
                  <p>Within the switchboard, electrical current is carried by a <term>bus</term> or <term>bus bar</term>, not by wires or cables. In an electrical system, a bus refers to a conducting bar or strip that serves as a common connection point for multiple electrical circuits.  It's like a highway for electrical current to flow to different destinations. Buses are typically made of  copper must have sufficient cross-sectional area to handle the required current.</p>
                  <p>The training ship has two high voltage main switchboards (HVMSB);  Switchboard one is located in the forward engine room, and switchboard two is the after engine room.  Each switchboard is divided into two connected buses:  Switchboard one contains buses one and two, switchboard two contains buses three and four.  The buses are interconnected with circuit breakers to permit the power to be re-routed in an emergency. </p>
                  <p>The bus bars are connected through circuit breakers to directly supply to some of the major electrical consumers, and also supply <term>load centers</term>.  Load centers are smaller switchboard or electrical panels located around the ship that contain their own bus and further distribute power to smaller, nearby electrical consumers.  Load centers may also be called <em>group-control centers</em>, <em>distribution boards</em>, or <em>power panels</em>.</p>
                  <p>The NSMV power distribution system consists of the following: <ul>
                        <li>2 <term>HV switchboards</term> (6.6kV) Supply power to the propulsion motors, bow and stern thrusters, and supply the low voltage switchboards.</li>
                        <li>2 <term>LV switchboards</term> (450V) Primarily supply the engine room machinery, and also lower voltage load centers and distribution boards.</li>
                        <li>1 <term>Emergency switchboard</term> (450/120V). This switchboard normally powered by the LV switchboard, but in the event of a power failure will be isolated and powered by the emergency generator.</li>
                        <li>4 <term>LV load center panels</term> (440V) Supply power to other machinery, including the galley and laundry equipment, and downstream distribution boards.</li>
                        <li>4 <term>120 V load center panels</term> (120V) Supply power to 120 V distribution boards, including galley and laundry.</li>
                        <li>3 <term>Emergency load center panels</term> (440V) Provide power to vital 440 volt loads.</li>
                        <li>3 <term>Emergency load center panels</term> (120V) Provide power to vital 120 volt loads,</li>
                        <li>16 <term>Distribution boards</term> (440V)  Provide power to non-vital 440 volt loads.</li>
                        <li>18 <term>Distribution boards</term> (120/240V) Provide power to non-vital 120 and 240 volt loads,</li>
                        <li>24 <term>Lighting distribution boards</term> (120V), provide the majority of ship’s lighting and outlets.</li>
                        <li>13 <term>Emergency Lighting distribution boards</term> (120V), supply the <q>E</q> lights which sufficient lighting to safely evacuate the ship in an emergency.</li>

                  <p>Each distribution branch is protected by multiple circuit breakers that protect the system from overloads, short circuits, and other faults.  The circuit breakers are <term>coordinated</term> so that when a fault occurs, the  circuit breaker closest to the fault trips, interrupting the flow of current to the fault area while minimizing disruption to the remainder of the system.</p>

                  <title>Power Management System</title>
                  <p>The electrical system aboard the training vessel is fully automated by a <term>Power Management System</term> (PMS).</p>
                  <p>The main purpose of the PMS is to ensure that there is always a sufficient power reserve available for the essential services of the vessel.  The system continuously monitors the generators and the electrical loads, and automatically starts and stops generators to match electrical power generation to the ship’s needs.</p>
                  <p>During critical times when energy demand is exceptionally high or during emergencies, the power management system can shed or temporarily drop non-essential loads. This ensures that essential equipment and services receive power while minimizing strain on the electrical system.</p>

         <title>Electrical Propulsion</title>
         <introduction>
            <p>Marine electric propulsion systems utilize generators to provide power for electric motors, which in turn drive the ship's propeller. The electric generators may be driven by any suitable prime mover, most commonly, diesel engines. While it may initially seem counterintuitive to interpose complex and costly equipment between the prime mover and the propeller when a simple line shaft and gearbox could transmit the power instead, there are valid justifications for the added complexity and expense. </p>
            <p>The advantages of electric propulsion include: <ul>
                  <li>
                     <title>Layout Flexibility</title>
                     <p>One notable advantage of electric propulsion is the ability to install the prime mover in any convenient location, without being restricted to a direct line with the propeller. Power is transmitted through flexible cable runs, as opposed to rigid line shafts. Furthermore, instead of relying on a single large main engine, multiple smaller engines can be used, allowing for placement in smaller spaces and more convenient locations.	</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <title>Efficient Operation</title>
                     <p>Electric propulsion systems enable both the prime mover and the propeller to operate at their optimal speeds, eliminating the need for reduction gears. Typically, medium speed diesel engines are coupled with low-speed motors and propellers. The speed reduction is accomplished by selecting the appropriate number of motor poles, and the shaft speed (RPM) is established by adjusting the electrical frequency to the motor. This setup allows each component to operate within its most efficient range, maximizing overall energy efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <title>Economical Part-Load Operation</title>
                     <p>By employing multiple generators operating in parallel, ships can secure one or more engines under reduced load conditions. The remaining engines can then operate at nearly full load, resulting in improved efficiency compared to having more engines operating at part-load. Load management systems continuously monitor the electrical demand and promptly initiate the startup of an additional generator when necessary.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <title>Redundancy and Reliability</title>
                     <p>Electric propulsion systems provide inherent redundancy and enhanced reliability compared to traditional propulsion systems. With multiple smaller generator sets, the system can continue to function even if one or more generators or motors fail or require maintenance.

            <p>An overview of the electric propulsion system of the <em>Patriot State II</em> is shown in the one-line diagram below, <xref ref="propulsion_system"/>.</p>
            <p>Electrical power for both propulsion and ship’s services is produced by four Hyundai HSJ9 913-08P diesel driven generators.    These are 6600 Volt, three-phase AC synchronous generators capable of producing up to 4053 kW at 80% power factor, or 5066.25 kVA. </p>
            <p>Generators 1 and 2 are located in engineroom 1 and directly feed main switchboard No.1, and generators 3 and 4 are located in engine room 2 and feed main switchboard No. 2.  The switchboards can be split or cross-connected as necessary for emergency operations.</p>

               <title>Description</title>
               <p>As discussed in <xref ref="AC_generators"/>, the essential components of an AC generator are the armature and the field, one of which is located on the rotor and the other on the stator.  However a practical generator requires many other components, including an enclosure, bearings, cooling, lubrication, instrumentation and control, and a method to excite the field.  </p>
               <p>These components are shown in <xref ref="generator"/> and  <xref ref="generator_exploded"/> and discussed below.</p>
               <p>The shaft is supported by two journal bearings (7 and 13), one on the drive end (<term>DE</term>) and the other on the non-drive end (<term>NDE</term>).  Each bearing has its own integral oil sump with sight glass, cooling fins, and an oil ring that circulates the oil to the top of the shaft as it rotates. </p>
               <p>The shaft itself supports and carries the rotating components: primarily the main rotor core (9) and the 8-pole main field windings (4), but also a cooling fan (2) and several other components (10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 19) that are required to excite the generator.  Excitation systems will be discussed in <xref ref="Electric-propulsion-excitation-system"/>. </p>
               <p>The main field (4) on the rotor is wound to create eight alternating north and south poles. The main stator core (8) surrounds the main rotor (9) and is wound with three main armature windings (3).  As the shaft rotates, the rotor’s magnetic field sweeps by the each of the three armature windings in turn, and induces a sinusoidal voltage in each as shown in <xref ref="three-phase"/>.  The resulting 3-phase AC is directed to the generator terminals (23), and from there connections are made to the main switchboard.</p>

               <p>Both the main core and the stator core are made of thin sheets of <term>electrical steel</term>, called <term>laminations</term>, clamped tightly together. The stationary armature windings (3) and the rotating field windings (4) are inserted into slots formed when the laminations were pressed out, and are firmly wedged in to hold them in position. </p>
               <p>Electrical steel is a speciality steel used in the cores of electrical machines such as motors, generators, and transformers. It is an iron alloy with silicon (instead of carbon) as the main additive element. Silicon increases the electrical resistivity of iron by a factor of about 5.  Electrical steel also has favorable magnetic properties which tend to reduce magnetic <term>hysteresis</term>
                  <mdash/> an energy loss caused by the repeated magnetization and de magnetization of the core.  These properties reduce energy losses in the core by about three times compared to conventional steel,</p>
               <p>The laminations are insulated from each other to prevent current from flowing axially along the core.  These currents, called <term>eddy currents</term>, are another source of energy loss, so using insulated laminations improves the generator efficiency.  </p>
               <p>Generators produce lots of heat while they are operating due to unavoidable losses caused by mechanical friction and electrical resistance, and other factors.  If this heat is not removed as it is produced, the generator temperature will rise to unacceptable limits, and high temperature is extremely damaging to electrical insulation. Electrical machines are designed to run for 100,000 hours or more when operated at or below their design temperature limit, however for every 10° C rise above this temperature, the thermal life expectancy of the electrical insulation is reduced by half, so generator cooling is critical.</p>
               <p>The generator’s cooling system uses the shaft driven internal fan (2) to circulate the air through the machine. This hot air passes over a water-cooled heat exchanger where it is cooled and then recirculated.  The cooling water tubes are double walled with slotted plate fins. Water flows through the inner tube and cools the outer tube and the slotted fins. Air flows between the fins and around the outer tubes and so is cooled.  </p>
               <p>In the case of a tube leak,  water will flow between the inner and outer tubes to a leak detector and trigger an alarm.  This prevents water from leaking on to the electrical components.</p>
               <p>If for some reason the cooling water is not available, an  emergency cooling mode is available.  In this mode  cover plates on the generator are removed to allow the fan to draw cool air from the engine room and discharge the heated air outside the generator. </p>

            <subsection xml:id="Electric-propulsion-excitation-system">
               <title>Excitation System</title>
               <introduction>
                  <p>The purpose of the excitation system is to <term>excite</term> the generator’s field.  That is, the system supplies the DC voltage and current to the generator’s main field windings that creates the magnetic field required for electrical generation.  The amount of excitation current determines the strength of this field, which in turn affects the generator output.</p>
                  <p>Generator excitation systems consists of several components that work together excite the field, maintain a constant and correct output voltage despite fluctuations in the load or other system conditions, and balance the reactive power when the generator is operating in parallel.</p>
                  <p>There are several different excitation system designs in use, each with particular advantages and disadvantages. These can be broadly categorized as separately or self excited, and brushed or brushless excitation systems.</p>
                  <p>In a <term>separately excited</term> excitation system, the excitation current is provided by an external DC power source. The generator's field winding is connected to a separate power supply, which is independent of the generator's output.  Separately excited generators tend to be more stable and less sensitive to load fluctuations because the excitation current is not affected by the generator's output. They provide better voltage regulation and are commonly used in applications that require precise control.</p>
                  <p>A <term>self-excited</term> system, on the other hand, uses the generator’s own output voltage to produce the excitation current. The generator's output voltage is connected, in parallel, to both the field circuit and to the load. In this design, generator excitation is effectively an additional load on the generator.  Self-excited generators are simpler and less expensive, but are inherently less stable and more sensitive to load changes due to the coupling between the generator load, output voltage, and excitation current. Voltage regulation is more difficult, especially under sudden changes in load.</p>
                  <p>
                     <term>Brushed</term> exciters use carbon brushes and copper slip rings to transmit the excitation current to the rotating generator rotor winding. Brushed exciters are simple and inexpensive and they were once widely used; however, they require significant maintenance including cleaning, adjustment, and periodic replacement of worn brushes.  They are being superseded by brushless exciters in new generators.</p>
                  <p>
                     <term>Brushless</term> exciters use solid-state devices, such as diodes, thyristors, and transistors mounted on the rotating shaft, to rectify the output voltage of the exciter generator.  They eliminate the need for brushes and slip rings, so are more reliable, require less maintenance, and offer better voltage control than brushed exciters.</p>

                  <p>An <term>exciter</term>, also known as an <term>excitation generator</term>, is a second generator which spins on the same shaft as the main generator.  The function of the exciter is to produce the direct current required to energize the main rotor windings, thereby creating a magnetic field. </p>
                  <p>There are several important differences between the main generator and the exciter.  Although both are 3-phase generators, the main generator has a rotating field and a stationary armature while the exciter has a stationary field and a rotating armature.   The exciter is much smaller than the main generator; the main generator can generate more than 440 A, while the exciter generates less than 4 A.</p>

                  <p>In other words, the main generator is excited by the exciter, and the exciter is excited by the pilot generator. This process stops here however, because the field of the pilot generator is produced by permanent magnets, not a field winding.  For this reason, the pilot generator is alternately called the <term>permanent magnet generator</term> or the <term>PMG</term>.</p>
                  <p>The pilot generator is shown in <xref ref="pilot_generator"/>.  It is located at the end of the shaft outboard of the bearing on the non-drive end of the generator unit  .  The rotor carries sixteen permanent magnets of alternating polarities bolted to the rotating shaft.  The stator is bolted onto the bearing housing and carries 3-phase wye-connected armature windings.  The rotating magnets induce a three-phase AC voltage into the stator windings.</p>
                  <p>The output of the pilot generator is transmitted to the automatic voltage regulator where it is rectified to DC, and then used to excite the stationary exciter field.  </p>

                  <p>Because the source of the excitation in this generator is from permanent magnets, rather than an electromagnet excited by the output of the main generator, the generator is considered separately excited.  The main advantage of separate excitation is that fluctuations in the voltage of the main generator do not affect the excitation supply. Voltage fluctuations can be quickly corrected and the generator output can be maintained within tight tolerances..</p>

                  <p>The three main components of the AVR are the Digital Signal Processor, the Rectifier, and the Power Module. The device uses a combination of hardware and software to perform its functions.</p>
                  <p>The <term>Digital Signal Processor</term>
                     <term>(DSP)</term> is a specialized microprocessor designed to process and manipulate digital signals in real time.  The DSP software is executable code stored in nonvolatile Flash memory.  The DSP executes code and controls hardware to enable the AVR to perform functions such as regulation, measurement, monitoring, protection, and communications.</p>
                  <p>The DSP accepts both digital and analog inputs, the most important being the generator voltage and current, which are measured using current and potential (voltage) transformers on the generator output, and digitized by an <term>analog to digital converter</term> (<term>ADC</term>) in the DSP.  Based on these values and the system requirements, the DSP calculates the amount of excitation current required and produces a command signal that is transmitted to the Power Module.</p>
                  <p>The <term>Rectifier</term> module supplies DC power to the power module.  The power source for the module may come from a Permanent Magnet Generator, as done on the training ship, or directly from the main generator terminals if the generator is self-excited.  The module uses a three-phase full-wave rectifier, <xref ref="three_phase_rectifier"/>, to convert the supply to a DC voltage. </p>
                  <p>The Power Module uses <term>pulse width modulation</term>
                     <term>(PWM)</term> to trigger a set of <term>insulated gate bipolar transistors</term> (<term>IGBT)</term> that supply the requested excitation current  An excitation current signal is transmitted back to the DSP to be used for to PID feedback, and for over-excitation limitation, protection functions and monitoring.  PWM and IGBTs are discussed in more detail in <xref ref="what-is-pulse-width-modulation" text="title"/> and <xref ref="what-is-an-igbt" text="title"/>.</p>

                  <p>The propulsion transformers reduce the network voltage (6,600 V) to the requirements of the frequency converters (1,850V).   The transformers have a single primary winding, delta connected, and two secondary windings, one is delta connected and the other is wye connected. This provides a 30° phase shift in one of the supplies to the diode front end.  This arrangement effectively provides a 12-pulse configuration that reduces harmful harmonics. </p>
                  <p>The diode bridge is made up of four stacks of six diodes, one stack to each transformer secondary. The output is passed to the DC Capacitor and filter circuit in the DCC cabinet . </p>

                  <p>This section houses the DC filter capacitor banks.These capacitors store energy and filter the rectified AC to remove any residual ripple from the waveform to provide a more stable DC supply. The capacitors are water cooled. During the power sequence they are all pre-charged.</p>

                  <title>INV <ndash/> Inverter</title>
                  <p>The inverter section contains three subassemblies called <term>stacks</term>, one for each phase of the output.  Each stack consists of four IGBT and two diode <term>press pack</term> modules, a gate driver, water-cooled heat sink and balancing resistors.   </p>
                  <p>The term press pack refers to the physical packaging of electronic components.  It typically consists of a semiconductor chip,  along with its associated control and protection circuitry, mounted between two metal plates which serve as electrical contacts and provide mechanical support. These plates are made of good thermal conductors such as copper or aluminum. This design allows for efficient heat dissipation, as the metal plates can be directly attached to a heat sink.</p>

                  <p>The ILC cubicle contains instrumentation to measure the DC link voltage, output current measurements, and the DC link grounding switch.  </p>
                  <p>This module also protects the inverter and DC bus from damage caused by the propulsion motors when the ship is slowing down.  During these periods the momentum of the ship will drive the propellor and motor, causing the motors to behave like generators and produce electrical power.  </p>
                  <p>Excessive electrical power cannot be fed back into the electrical distribution system, so when the DC bus reaches a certain voltage, the excess energy is shunted through a chopper unit to braking resistors.  The braking resistors are located near the converter rooms, and are capable of dissipating up to 10 MJ for 20 seconds once every 30 minutes</p>

               <p>The propeller shaft is supported by journal bearings which maintain radial alignment, and a thrust bearing which transmits thrust from the propeller to the hull and  maintains axial alignment. The shaft is equipped with turning gear and a shaft lock. When either of these is engaged, propulsion is blocked. </p>

               <p>The stator core is made up of electrically insulated sheets, braced with clamping bolts and rings and mounted in the stator housing. The stator windings consists of layered coils mounted in the open slots of the stator core. The stator has two terminal boxes on the stator housing for electrical connections. </p>
               <p>The rotor is comprised of a forged shaft with a shrunk on rotor body. The rotor windings are formed by bars and rings embedded together and brazed by an induction heating method to form a squirrel cage. </p>
               <p>The rotor is supported with self-lubricated, bushed bearings. There are two jacking oil pumps for the drive end bearings and two jacking oil pumps for the non-drive end bearings, normally with one operating and one in standby. </p>
               <p>The motors are fitted with two air-water heat exchangers providing cooled air which is forced through internal cooling openings via four 440V 9.2 kW electric-motor driven fans. This air is then circulated back to the coolers. In the event of fan failure, it is still possible to operate at a reduced speed.  In the event of cooling water failure, the motor is provided with emergency air openings in the cooler hood and in the stator housing which can be removed for natural cooling. </p>

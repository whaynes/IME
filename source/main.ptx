         <title>Piping Systems</title>
         <introduction>
            <p>
               <term>Piping  </term>is an assembly of pipe or tubing, valves, fittings, and related components forming a whole or a part of a system for transferring fluids (which includes both liquids and gases) from one location to another.</p>
            <p>This chapter deals with the components that make up these systems. </p>

            <title>Pipe and Tube</title>
            <introduction>
               <p>Both pipes and tubes are long, hollow structures but the distinction between them is somewhat unclear.</p>
               <p>
                  <term>Pipes</term> are primarily used for fluid transport and are almost always cylindrical.  They are sized in terms of a <term>Nominal Pipe Size</term> (NPS) or Nominal Diameter (DN), which corresponds to the approximate <term>inside diameter</term> (ID). The internal diameter is the critical dimension for fluid flow, since it is needed to calculate pipe capacity, flow rates, and frictional losses.  Additionally, pipes must have sufficient <term>wall thickness</term> to handle the expected internal pressure.  Pipes have somewhat lenient tolerances, and may have variations in wall thickness along their length.</p>
               <p>
                  <term>Tubes</term> are used for fluid transport as well, but also for other applications, particularly for fabricating structures. (For example, scaffolding and bike frames.)  Pipes are rigid and resistant to bending but some tubes such as copper and brass tubes are flexible enough to be easily bent. </p>
               <p>Tubes are available with various cross-sections, including round, square, rectangular, or oval.  They usually have thinner walls than pipe, making them lighter but less capable of handling high internal pressures. They are often chosen for applications where weight is a consideration. Tubes are sized based on <em>outside</em> dimensions and wall thickness.  Tubes are manufactured with tighter tolerances than pipe, resulting in more precise dimensions and wall thickness consistency.  </p>

            <subsection xml:id="piping-systems-pipe-size">
               <title>Pipe Size</title>
               <p>Pipe sizes in the United States are specified by two numbers:  The <term>Nominal Pipe Size</term>  (NPS) in inches  and the <term>Schedule</term> (Sch.) number.   The European (ISO) designation equivalent to nominal pipe size is <foreign>
                     <term>diam√®tre nominal</term>
                  </foreign> (DN), where the dimensions are measured in millimeters. </p>
               <p>In engineering a <term>nominal</term> value is a quantity used for the <em>name</em> of an object.  Nominal values are usually close to, but not the same as, the actual value.   For example a 2<m>\times</m>4 is the name of a piece of lumber with finished dimensions closer to 1-1/2 inches by 3-1/2 inches.  A 120 V outlet can vary anywhere between 114 V and 126 V.  Nominal values are a convenient shorthand, a rounded figure easier to use and remember.</p>
               <p>The NPS is <em>approximately</em> equal to the <em>inside</em> diameter of the pipe for nominal pipe sizes up to 12 inches;  above 12 inches, the nominal pipe size is equal to the outside diameter.  Nominal dimensions are used in order to simplify the standardization of pipe fittings and pipe taps and threading dies. Pipe fittings with and pipe with the same nominal size are compatible.</p>
               <p>
                  <term>Pipe schedule</term> describes the wall thickness of pipes. There are eleven standard Schedule numbers: 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160, with higher numbers indicating thicker walls. The most common sizes found aboard ship are Schedule 40, sometimes called <term>standard weight</term>, and Schedule 80.   Schedule 40 is the lightest weight used for steam applications.  Schedule 40 and 80 pipes are available in the full range of nominal sizes from 1/8 inch to 48 inch.  Other schedules are more limited. </p>
               <p>As the schedule number increases, the pipe wall thickness increases, the inside diameter (<term>bore</term>) decreases and the pressure rating of the pipe increases,  so for example a 1 inch Schedule 40 pipe which has an outside diameter of  1.315 inches and a wall thickness of 0.133 inches, has a bore of 1.049 inches, while a similar 1 inch Schedule 80 pipe has the same outside diameter, but a wall thickness of 0.179 inches giving a bore of 0.957 inch </p>

                  <title>Pipe Thread</title>



Pipe thread standards are standardized specifications that define the characteristics of threaded connections used in pipes and pipe fittings. These standards ensure compatibility and interchangeability between different components in piping systems. There are several pipe thread standards used around the world, each with its own characteristics and applications. Here are some of the most common pipe thread standards:


1. **NPT (National Pipe Thread):**
   - NPT is a widely used thread standard in the United States and Canada.
   - There are two main types: NPT (Tapered) and NPTF (Dryseal).
   - NPT threads are tapered, which helps create a seal by wedging the threads together as the fittings are tightened.
   - NPTF threads have modified shapes to improve sealing without the need for thread sealants.

2. **BSPT (British Standard Pipe Thread):**
   - BSPT is a common thread standard in the United Kingdom and many countries that were part of the British Empire.
   - BSPT threads are also tapered, like NPT threads.
   - Common types include BSPT (Tapered) and BSPP (Parallel or Straight).

3. **BSPP (British Standard Pipe Parallel):**
   - BSPP threads are parallel or straight threads used in conjunction with BSPT threads.
   - BSPP threads do not create a tight seal without the use of additional sealing methods.

4. **BSPF (British Standard Pipe Fitting):**
   - BSPF threads are used in specialized fittings and require the use of a sealing washer to create a seal.

5. **Metric Thread Standards:**
   - ISO 7-1 (BSP) and ISO 228-1 (BSPT) are metric thread standards used in various countries.
   - These standards are commonly used in Europe and other regions where the metric system is prevalent.

6. **G (German) Thread Standard:**
   - The DIN 3852-1 standard defines the G thread, which is a parallel thread used in Germany and some other European countries.

7. **JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) Thread:**
   - JIS threads are used in Japan and other countries that follow Japanese industrial standards.
   - These threads are often found in specialized applications and components.

8. **UN/UNF Thread Standards:**
   - Unified National (UN) and Unified National Fine (UNF) thread standards are widely used in the United States for various applications, including pipes and fittings.

9. **API (American Petroleum Institute) Thread Standards:**
   - API thread standards, such as API 5B and API 5C, are used specifically in the petroleum industry for oil and gas pipes and equipment.

It's important to choose the correct thread standard for your application to ensure proper fit, sealing, and functionality of the piping system. Mismatched threads can lead to leaks, inefficiencies, and other issues. Always refer to relevant standards and guidelines when selecting and using pipe threads and fittings.
WHAT ARE NPT FITTINGS?

NPT(National Pipe Tapered) standard was initially defined for plumbing applications. The metal-to-metal contact in NPT fittings relies on the deformation of the threads to form a secure seal.

		Fittings Learning Center Fittings and Adapters What are NPT Fittings?

Image description: A NPT fitting
NPT or national pipe, or National Pipe Tapered, is an American standard defined under the AMSE B1.20.1. The standard outlines the dimensions and tolerances of tapered threads for pipes and fittings. Unlike straight threads, tapered threads give a more reliable seal, especially when used with a sealant material like Teflon tape. The standard is more than a hundred years old and was initially defined for plumbing applications; however, it has seen effective use in hydraulic and gas conveyance as well.
CHARACTERISTICS OF NPT THREADS
NPT threads are defined by the following features:
	‚Ä¢	The taper angle is 1O 47‚Äô (measured from the center axis of the NPT fitting)
	‚Ä¢	Flat crests and troughs
	‚Ä¢	60O angle between each crest and trough
	‚Ä¢	The outer diameter of an NPT fitting is measured at the midpoint of the taper
	‚Ä¢	Pitch (the distance between threads) is measured in threads per inch (TPI)
SIZING IN NPT THREADS
NPT defines both internal and external threads on fittings that conform to the standard; hence sizing charts give diameter measurements for both male and female parts. As a result, all male and female fitting types have consistency, adhering to the same taper rate ‚Äì change in thread diameter per unit length. For the NPT standard, the taper rate is ¬æ inch per foot or 1/16 inch per inch.
Since the O.D. is measured from the midpoint, confusion may arise when selecting the correct size fitting. An NPT fitting labeled as 1/8‚Äù has an actual outer diameter of 3/8‚Äù. So be careful when selecting NPT fittings, as you may end up using a fitting that‚Äôs too loose. The chart below summarizes the dimensions of some commonly used sizes. Note that some NPT fitting sizes have the same TPI; hence they can be used on each other on account of the taper. 


ADVANTAGES OF USING NPT THREAD FITTINGS
Given that the standard has been around for a while, it has a set of advantages when being used. It is readily available in vendor inventories, with multiple sizes and materials to choose from. This allows you to use them for many applications at varying pressures. Moreover, they can be assembled in a simple manner as the metal-to-metal contact offers an excellent seal.
DISADVANTAGES OF USING NPT THREAD FITTINGS
The metal-to-metal contact in NPT fittings relies on the deformation of the threads to form a secure seal. This, however, means that one cannot use them in applications that require frequent disassembly.
If used improperly, that is, without correct alignment, overtightening, or wrong sizing, ports may expand, and cracks may form on the threads. This, in turn, leads to the formation of leakage pathways from where the medium can leak out. It is for this reason that NPT fittings are not recommended for extremely high-pressure applications.

https://www.cpcworldwide.com/Resources-Support/Technical-Toolbox/Understanding-NPT-Pipe-Thread-Types

Pipe thread sizes are based on an inside diameter (ID) or flow size. For example, ‚Äú1/2‚Äì14 NPT‚Äù identifies a pipe thread with a nominal inside diameter of 1/2 inch and 14 threads to the inch, made according to the NPT standard. If ‚ÄúLH‚Äù is added, the pipe has a left hand thread. The most commonglobal pipe thread forms are:
	‚ñ™	NPT: American Standard Pipe Taper Thread
	‚ñ™	NPSC: American Standard Straight Coupling Pipe Thread
	‚ñ™	NPTR: American Standard Taper Railing Pipe Thread
	‚ñ™	NPSM: American Standard Straight Mechanical Pipe Thread
	‚ñ™	NPSL: American Standard Straight Locknut Pipe Thread
	‚ñ™	NPTF: American Standard Pipe Thread Tapered (Dryseal)
	‚ñ™	BSPP: British Standard Pipe Thread Parallel
	‚ñ™	BSPT: British Standard Pipe Thread Tapered
Plastic injection molded thread forms are manufactured to ANSI B2.1 and SAE J476 standards.
The word ‚Äútapered‚Äù in several of the above names points to the big difference between many pipe threads and those on bolts and screws. Many pipe threads must make not only a mechanical joint but also a leakproof hydraulic seal. This is accomplished by the tapered thread form of the male matching the thread form of the female tapered thread and the use of pipe sealant to fill any voids between the two threads which could cause a spiral leak. The bottoms of the threads aren‚Äôt on a cylinder, but a cone; they taper. The taper is 1‚ÅÑ16 inch per inch of length, which is the same as 3/4 inch in a foot.
Because of the taper, a pipe thread can only screw into a fitting a certain distance before¬†it jams. The standard specifies this distance as the length of hand tight engagement, the distance the pipe thread can be screwed in by hand. It also specifies another distance ‚Äì the effective thread, this is the length of the thread which makes the seal on a conventional machined pipe thread. For workers, instead of these distances, it is more convenient to know how many turns to make by hand and how many with a wrench. A simple rule of thumb for installing tapered pipe threads, both metal and plastic, is finger tight plus one to two turns with a wrench. Torque installation values can be determined per application, but due to the variations involved in pipe joints such as disimiliar materials of male and female threads, type of sealants used, and internal¬†variations in product wall thickness, a standard torque specification cannot be generically applied.</paragraphs>

PIPE FITTINGS

Pipe or tubing alone does not constitute a piping system. To make the pipe or tubing into a system, it is necessary to have a variety of fittings, connections, and accessories by which the sections of pipe or tubing can be properly joined and the flow of the transferred fluid may be controlled. The following sections of this chapter deal with some of the pipe fittings most commonly used in shipboard piping systems; these fittings include unions, flanges, expansion joints, flareless fluid connections, steam traps, strainers, and valves.

UNIONS

Union fittings are provided in piping systems to allow the piping to be taken down for repairs and alterations. Unions are available in many different materials and designs to withstand a wide range of pressures and temperatures. Figure 14-1 shows some commonly used types of unions.

FLANGES

Flanges are used in piping systems to allow easy removal of piping and other equipment. The materials used and the design of the flanges are governed by the requirements of service. Flanges in steel piping systems are usually welded to the pipe or tubing. Flanges in nonferrous systems are usually brazed to the pipe or tubing.

EXPANSION JOINTS

Expansion joints are used in some piping systems to allow the piping to expand and contract with temperature changes, without damage to the piping. Two basic types of expansion joints are used in shipboard piping systems: sliding-type joints and flexing-type joints. Sliding-type expansion joints include sleeve joints, rotary joints, ball and socket joints, and joints made up of some combination of these types. The amount of axial and rotary motion that can be abosrbed by any particular type</subsection>

               <title>Bends and elbows</title>
               <p>Bends and elbows are important parts of any piping system as they allow the integration of flexibility of design by change in the flow direction of the media to be carried inside</p>
               <p>The details of these important components are discussed in this chapter</p>
               <p> Bend or Elbow</p>
               <p>There is always a doubt about the terms bends and elbows on ships.</p>
               <p>They are frequently used as synonyms. between them is as follows:</p>
               <p>The difference</p>
               <p> * Bend is a generic term for any offset or change of direction in the piping. It is a vague term that also includes elbows.</p>
               <p>* An elbow is an engineering term and is classified as 90 deg or 45 deg, short or long radius.</p>
               <p>* Elbows have industrial standards and have limitations to size, bend radius and angle. The angles are usually 45 deg or 90 degrees. All others offsets are classified as pipe bends.</p>
               <p>* Bends are generally made or fabricated as per the need of the piping; however elbows are pre fabricated and standard, and are available off the shelf.</p>
               <p>* Bends are never sharp corners but elbows are. Pipe bending techniques have constraint as to how much material thinning can be allowed to safely contain the pressure of the fluid to be contained. As elbows are pre fabricated, cast or butt welded, they can be sharp like right angles and return elbows which are 180 degrees.</p>
               <p>* Elbow is a standard fitting but bends are custom fabricated.</p>
               <p>* In bends as the pipe is bent and there is no welding involved, there is less pipe friction and flow is smoother. In elbows, the welding can create some friction.</p>
               <p>* All elbows are bends but all bends are not elbows.</p>
               <p>* Bend has a larger radius then elbows. 2</p>
               <p>  * Generally the most basic difference is the radius of curvature. Elbows generally have radius of curvature between one to twice the diameter of the</p>
               <p>pipe. Bends have a radius of curvature more than twice the diameter.</p>
               <p>Short Radius and Long Radius</p>
               <p>Elbows are again classified as long radius or short radius elbows. The difference between them of the length and curvature.</p>
               <p>Following are some points to differentiate these two:</p>
               <p>* Long radius elbows give less frictional resistance to the fluid than the short elbows.</p>
               <p>* Long radius elbows create lesser pressure drop than short radius elbows.</p>
               <p>* Short radius is less costly than long radius elbows.</p>
               <p>* The short radius elbows are used where there is scarcity of space.</p>
               <p> A short radius elbow will be giving the piping a sharper turn than a long radius elbow.</p>
               <p>In a long radius elbow the radius of curvature is 1.5 times the nominal diameter. In a standard elbow the radius of curvature is 1.0 times the nominal diameter of the pipe.</p>
               <p>In addition to this classification the elbows of 45 degrees, 90 degrees and 180 degrees are called as a return elbow.</p>
               <p>  Miter bends</p>
               <p>Another type of bend is a Miter bend. A Miter bend is a bend which is made by cutting pipe ends at an angle and joining the pipe ends. A true miter bend is a 90 degree bend made by cutting two pipes at 45 degrees and joining them by</p>
               <p>welding. Similarly three pipes cut at 22.5 degrees will give a 90 degree miter bend.</p>
               <p>  ‚ÄúMitered bends are simple to make and can be readily compensated to act acoustically.‚Äù</p>

               <p>Different types of elbows are used in the piping system of ships as per the space and design of installation.</p>

               <p>* Reducing Street Elbow</p>
               <p>A reducing street elbow is a pipe fitting that has male thread on one side and unequal female threads on other side. They are used for altering the direction of flow as well as joining pipes of two different sizes. They come in various angles like 45 degrees and 90 degrees.</p>

A nipple is a short piece of pipe that is used as a fitting to connect piping in plumbing applications. Nipple fittings are produced in various materials, although stainless steel nipples are the most common due to their strength and durability.
Stainless steel nipples are usually made with male pipe thread (MPT) connections on both ends, connecting two separate female threaded pipes and fittings. The connection allows for a watertight seal between the fittings.
Stainless steel nipples are primarily used in low-pressure piping systems, and the type of nipple used will vary with the size, temperature, and working pressure of the system. Therefore, depending on the specific application, there are various types of pipe nipples to choose from. This article will outline the uses of different types of stainless steel nipples.
CLOSE PIPE/RUNNING PIPE NIPPLE
A close pipe nipple is a stainless steel nipple that does not have an unthreaded section in the middle. These types of pipe nipples are also known as running nipples. These pipe nipples are designed such that connected fittings come very close to one another, leaving very little of the pipe nipple exposed.
Generally, close or running pipe nipples are difficult to work with as they can easily become damaged upon removal unless specialty equipment is used.
SHOULDER PIPE NIPPLE
Shoulder pipe nipples are longer than close nipples and have a very small section of unthreaded pipe in the middle. However, this unthreaded section is not large enough to fit a pipe wrench to remove the nipple.
HEXAGONAL PIPE NIPPLE
Also known as a Hex pipe nipple, these are designed with a hexagonal-shaped middle section. This allows one to securely grasp the nipple with a wrench to tighten or remove it. This design feature provides a greater mechanical advantage than that of a normally rounded nipple. Hence, hex pipe nipples are used in various applications where nipples need to be regularly removed or replaced.
REDUCING/UNEQUAL PIPE NIPPLE
Reducing or unequal pipe nipples are designed to allow a female fitting with a large connection to attach to a relatively smaller one. These are normally used for piping systems where a change in pipe dimension and flow pressure is necessary.
HOSE PIPE NIPPLE
A Hose pipe nipple is designed with a male threaded connection on one end and a hose barb on the other end. These are normally used for piping systems that require a pipe to be connected to tubing.
WELDING PIPE NIPPLE
A welding pipe nipple has a male threaded connection on one end and a standard cut pipe on the other end. Once the unthreaded end is welded and connected, fitting a pipe to the threaded end becomes much easier. Welding pipe nipples are normally used in piping systems that require welding to connect components.

How To Measure Pipe Nipple Length? (5 Types)
by Pip's Island Home

Are you doing a DIY plumbing project and wondering how pipe nipples are measured? Or perhaps you are a plumbing rookie curious how to measure pipe nipples?
Ordering the right size nipple is important in any successful plumbing installation. This small but crucial pipe fittings make all the difference in guaranteeing leakage-free low-pressure piping systems.
So, just how are pipe nipples measured? This is a common concern among plumbing newbies looking to understand pipe fitting dimensions.
Determining pipe nipple size is straightforward as you will find out in this guide. Read on for details on pipe nipples and how to measure the dimensions accurately when ordering these necessary fittings.
What Is A Pipe Nipple?


A pipe nipple is a fitting made from a short piece of pipe and typically comes with male threads on both ends. A nipple acts as an adapter, connecting two female threaded pipes or fittings.
Manufacturers make nipples by cutting pipes of a certain length and creating the specific end connections that make the nipple unique. Like pipe, nipples can be welded or seamless.
Nipples usually come in various lengths, but most are about 12‚Äù. Before discussing how pipe nipples are measured, let‚Äôs first look at the most common types of pipe nipples.
Most Common Types Of Pipe Nipples
1. Close Or Running Nipple


One of the most common pipe nipples is the close nipple, also known as a running nipple. With this type of nipple, the entire short pipe is threaded with male threads. So when you connect a pipe on either end of the nipple, you wouldn‚Äôt see the nipple threads. The pipes or fittings on both sides come close, hiding the pipe nipple underneath.
One disadvantage of a close nipple is that it can be difficult to unscrew from a pipe or fitting. If you want to unscrew the connection, you must grip one of the nipple‚Äôs threaded ends with a pipe wrench, which could damage the threads, requiring you to replace the nipple. A nipple wrench to grip the pipe or fitting‚Äôs interior can minimize thread damage.
2. Hexagonal Nipple


A pipe nipple has a small unthreaded space between the two threaded ends. You can place a wrench on the unthreaded space to grasp the nipple and avoid damaging the threads.
The middle unthreaded space in some nipples has a hexagonal pattern resembling a nut. The hexagonal pattern provides a superior grip compared to a smooth pipe nipple.
In some nipples, the unthreaded hexagonal space is slightly longer, making the threaded ends shorter. This type of nipple is known as a long hex.
3. Reducing Nipple


Sometimes, you may want to connect differently-sized pipes or fittings, i.e., one fitting or pipe may be larger than the other. In this case, it is best to use a reducing nipple, also known as an unequal nipple.
A reducing nipple has the usual male threads on both ends but with different diameters. One end takes a female pipe with a larger connection, while the other end connects to a smaller pipe or fitting.
Be careful when connecting a large pipe to a small one. The increased flow rate and pressure in the smaller fitting or pipe can cause a sudden and potentially dangerous outburst.
4. Hose Nipple


Another common type of nipple is the hose pipe nipple. As the name suggests, these nipples connect pipe to tubing.
On one end of the nipple is a male threaded connection, while the other end of the nipple has a hose barb. The barb is usually more or less the same size as the threaded end of the nipple.
5. Welding Nipple


Welding nipples have one threaded and another non-threaded end that resembles a normal pipe. This nipple is handy when connecting a piping system to welded fittings or pipes.
The unthreaded end has a greater surface area to take welded fittings, ensuring a strong connection. Connecting pipes/fittings to the threaded end is easier when the unthreaded end is securely connected to the welded fitting.
When ordering pipe nipples, you must know the type of nipple that best suits your plumbing installation. Aside from the length and type of pipe, you should also understand the end connections required for your piping installation.
These are the most common pipe nipple end connections:
	‚Ä¢	Plain both ends (PBE): This nipple features threadless ends. It connects a welded socket in piping.
	‚Ä¢	Threaded both ends (TBE): Many pipe nipples are threaded on both ends and help to connect female threaded pipe or fittings.
	‚Ä¢	Beveled both ends (BBE): This pipe nipple connects welded pipes or fittings. It features beveled ends on both sides of the nipple.
Other variations include threaded one end, plain one end, and beveled one end. Your choice will depend on the design and function of the piping system.
How To Measure Pipe Nipple Length?


When determining the right type of pipe nipple to buy, you must specify the following:
	‚Ä¢	Inner or outer diameter
	‚Ä¢	Pipe nipple length
	‚Ä¢	Preferred nipple material
	‚Ä¢	Type of end connection
How are pipe nipples measured in terms of length? The length of a pipe nipple is the overall pipe length from one end of the nipple to the other. This formula applies whether the pipe nipple is plain on both ends, threaded on both ends, plain on one end, and threaded on the other. You can easily determine the nipple length using a caliper or thread and tape measure.
When pipe/fitting is installed on a pipe nipple, you can determine the nipple length by subtracting the thread engagement of both ends of the nipple. The engagement is the length of pipe inserted into the nipple to achieve a snug, hand-fitted seal.
In cases where the female threaded fittings come close to each other such that the nipple doesn‚Äôt show, the close length is calculated as two times the thread engagement.
Use a nominal diameter conversion chart to determine the precise length of the pipe nipple in inches.
How Do You Determine Pipe Size?


In addition to learning how to measure pipe nipple size, you will also need to know how pipe size is measured. The upside is that determining pipe size is easy‚Äîall you need is the outside diameter for male threads and the inner diameter for female threads.
To measure the pipe size for pipe/fittings with male threads, follow these steps:
	1	Wrap a small string around the pipe
	2	Use a marker pen to indicate where the string touches
	3	Measure the string from the tip to the marked point using a tape measure or ruler. This is the pipe‚Äôs circumference.
	4	Obtain the diameter by dividing the circumference by 3.14
	5	Use the nominal diameter conversion chart to convert the diameter readings to the more accurate nominal diameter. The nominal diameter is the actual pipe size.
The steps to measure the pipe size of a female threaded pipe are as follows:
	1	Place a tape measure or ruler on the pipe‚Äôs opening to measure the inside diameter.
	2	Use the nominal diameter chart for pipe sizes to convert the inside diameter to the nominal diameter, which is the pipe‚Äôs actual size.
Tips For Measuring Metric Pipe Fittings


Pipe fittings, including pipe nipples with metric thread, are quite common. Metric threaded fittings are also classified as tapered because the threads narrow the further in you get.
If your pipe/fitting has metric threads, you should have the right thread measurements before ordering a pipe nipple that can take the metric threads.
So, how do you measure metric pipe fittings? Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide:
Measure the thread pitch using a pair of calipers or a thread gauge. The thread pitch is measured in mm, and typically measures 1.0, 1.5. or 2.0, but you can find fittings with larger thread pitches.
Determine the interior diameter for female threaded fittings and the outside diameter for male threaded fittings. This is how pipe thread is measured. (See the guide above on how to determine pipe size).
Use a metric thread specification chart to identify a thread callout that will give you an estimate measure of the metric pipe fitting. A thread callout combines the pitch measurement, and fitting‚Äôs outside diameter.
Summary: How Are Pipe Nipples Measured?
Pipe nipples are important in ensuring secure and safe connections in piping systems. The right type and size nipple make a world of difference regarding the integrity of any plumbing system.
Understanding how pipe nipples are measured will help you choose the right fittings. The figures might initially seem confusing, especially since you‚Äôd have to convert internal and outside diameters to nominal ones.
But, with the right tools and a simple formula to follow, you should quickly learn how to measure pipe nipples and even determine pipe sizes. I hope this handy guide helps you get the hang of measuring pipe nipple length and size.</subsection>

Several types of metals are commonly used for pipes on ships due to their specific properties and suitability for marine environments. The choice of metal depends on factors such as corrosion resistance, strength, cost, and the type of fluid or gas being transported. Here are some of the metals frequently used for pipes on ships:

1. **Carbon Steel:** Carbon steel pipes are widely used in shipbuilding due to their strength and cost-effectiveness. They are suitable for conveying various fluids and gases. However, carbon steel is susceptible to corrosion in marine environments, so protective coatings or regular maintenance might be necessary.

2. **Stainless Steel:** Stainless steel is a popular choice for ship pipes because of its excellent corrosion resistance. Different grades of stainless steel are used depending on the level of corrosion resistance required and the specific fluids being transported. Types like 316 and 316L are commonly used in marine applications.

3. **Copper:** Copper pipes are often used in ship plumbing systems for carrying freshwater and certain chemicals. Copper has good corrosion resistance and is especially effective against biofouling, making it suitable for potable water systems.

4. **Nickel Alloys:** Nickel alloys, such as Monel and Inconel, are used in ship systems where resistance to high temperatures, corrosion, and stress is required. These alloys are often used in systems that handle harsh chemicals or high-temperature fluids.

5. **Aluminum:** Aluminum pipes are lightweight and corrosion-resistant, making them ideal for applications where weight reduction is crucial, such as in air conditioning and ventilation systems.

6. **Titanium:** Titanium pipes are highly corrosion-resistant and lightweight, making them suitable for seawater cooling systems and other applications where corrosion is a concern. However, titanium is more expensive than many other materials.

7. **Brass:** Brass pipes are used in certain ship systems due to their corrosion resistance, especially in areas where saltwater exposure is frequent. They are commonly used in small-scale plumbing and valve systems.

8. **Duplex Stainless Steel:** Duplex stainless steels combine the benefits of austenitic and ferritic stainless steels, offering high strength and excellent corrosion resistance. They are used in applications requiring both strength and resistance to aggressive marine environments.

9. **Galvanized Steel:** Galvanized steel pipes are coated with a layer of zinc, providing moderate corrosion resistance. They are used in systems that are exposed to moisture and water, such as ballast systems.

The choice of metal for pipes on ships depends on the specific needs of each application, regulatory requirements, and the balance between performance and cost. In critical systems, where corrosion resistance and reliability are paramount, higher-grade materials like stainless steel and nickel alloys are often preferred.</section>

            <introduction>
               <p>In general, a valve is a device installed in a piping system to control the amount, direction or pressure of the contained fluid flowing through the pipe lines. Most valves control fluid flow with a carefully designed moving part which can fully open, partially open (called <em>throttling</em>), or close an opening called an <em>orifice</em> inside the valve. Since the valve must stop all fluid flow when it is closed, the surface of the moving part that covers the opening and the surface surrounding the stationary opening must be precisely machined and fitted. In many valves, both these surfaces are metal and they must seal tightly against one another without the aid of gaskets or seals between them. </p>
               <p>Various valves use one of four basic means of controlling flow:  <ul>
                     <li>a moving disk or plug blocking orifice; </li>
                     <li>sliding a flat, cylindrical or spherical surface across an orifice; </li>
                     <li>rotating a disk across the diameter of piping; </li>
                     <li>or, moving a flexible material into the flow path. </li>
                  </ul>
               </p>
               <p>The movable part inside the valve has its position controlled by a shaft or valve stem that passes through the valve body to the outside. The valve stem is rotated or moved axially depending on the valve design by one or a combination of the following methods:  <ul>
                     <li>Manually using a hand-wheel or lever </li>
                     <li>Electrically using electro-magnets (solenoids) or motors </li>
                     <li>Pneumatically using compressed air to move a piston or air motor </li>
                     <li>Hydraulically using pressurized oil to move a piston or hydraulic motor </li>
                  </ul>
               </p>
               <p>Several different types of valves are shown in <xref ref="valvetypes_png"/>. Of these, the most important types for shipboard use - globe, gate, check, plug, ball, butterfly, and relief - will be discussed in this chapter. </p>

               <title>Globe Valves</title>
               <p>Globe valves are used in throttling applications, that is, anytime you want to   regulate or control the amount of liquid flowing through a system, you could select a   globe valve. A bathroom sink faucet or a garden hose spigot are common examples of globe   valves found around the house. In a globe valve, the moving part (called the <em>valve     disk</em>) blocks an opening in the valve (called the <em>seat</em>) to shut off flow,   and when the valve stem is turned, the disk moves away from the seat ‚Äì in the path of   the fluid flow ‚Äì as the valve is opened. To close the globe valve, the disk is moved   back towards the seat until they touch, seal, and stop the fluid flow through the valve. </p>

                  <title>Construction</title>
                  <p>Globe valves are designed for tight closure and throttling applications. When a globe   valve is used to throttle or regulate fluid flow, the disk surface that closes against   the seat should be made from metal, not synthetic materials. Throttling a fluid creates   erosion (wearing away) of the disk surface and the seat surface that the fluid flows   between. This erosion may show up as general roughness or as small grooves cut across   the surfaces of the seat and disk, called <em>wire drawing</em>. These defects on the   precisely machined surfaces of the seat and disk result in leakage when the valve is   closed. In service where erosion will be a problem, the seat and disk can be fabricated   from very hard materials, such as stellite, to extend the life of the seat and disk   contact surfaces. </p>
                  <p>The <term>valve body</term> contains the internal opening that the fluid flows through. It   is called the <em>seat</em> if the opening is machined directly into the valve body   material. It is called a <em>seat ring</em> if it is a separate and replaceable part   from the valve body. Replaceable seat rings are generally manufactured from harder,   longer wearing materials than the valve body to be more resistant to fluid erosion at   this location. Seat rings may be retained in the valve body by machine screw threads,   press fit, welding or by what is known as a <em>shrink fit</em>. In shrink fit   applications, the machined hole in the valve body that the seat ring fits into is a few   thousandths of an inch smaller in diameter than the outside diameter of the seat ring.   Therefore, it is impossible for the ring to fit into the hole in the valve body. During   assembly the valve body is heated, causing the machined seat ring hole to expand. The   seat ring is also frozen at the same time to decrease its outside diameter. With both   parts at the proper temperature, the seat ring now has an outside diameter that is   smaller than the inside diameter of the machined hole in the valve body. At this point,   the seat ring is placed quickly and accurately into the valve body. As the temperature   of the two parts begin to equalize, the ring expands and the machined hole shrinks and   places a compressive force around the outside of the ring, locking it very tightly in   place. </p>
                  <p>The valve body has two external openings (and in some special valves, more) for the   entrance and exit of fluid from the piping system. These openings can be connected to   the piping using pipe threads, soldering, flanges, welding, or gluing. </p>
                  <p>The top of the valve body generally has an opening for the valve disk and stem to fit   through. At this opening, the other sub-assembly, called the <em>bonnet</em> is   attached. </p>
                  <p>The <term>bonnet</term> normally contains the equipment necessary to operate the movable   disk. It is attached to the body by machine screw threads or flanges . Large valves and   valves in high pressure service normally have a gasket between the bonnet and the body   made from sheet packing, flat metallic rings or spiral wound metallic type material.   Small valves may have the bonnet and body sealed by a lapped metal to metal fit with no   gaskets. </p>

                     <term>Construction Details.</term> Several interesting construction details are shown in     <xref ref="osborneglobe_png"/>, which shows a manually operated right-angle globe   valve. </p>
                  <p>This valve has a <term>stem</term> with a collar machined on the end. The <term>disk</term>   slides over the collar and is retained on the end of the stem by a <term>valve disk plug</term>  (or  <term>disk nut</term> ) which is attached to the disk by machine threads.   Since the disk plug is prevented from sliding off the end of the stem by the collar, it   effectively fastens the disk to the stem. The disk nut does not lock the disk tightly to   the stem, rather the disk is allowed to move slightly around the collar on the end of   the valve stem. This small movement allows the disk to align itself properly with the   seat as it closes for a leak free seal. In this valve, the stem is also the device that   keeps the disk correctly aligned with the seat, regardless of how far the disk is   removed from the seat. </p>
                  <p>Where the valve stem passes through the bonnet to the outside of the valve, the bonnet   has a <term>stuffing box</term>, <term>packing</term>, and a <term>packing gland</term>  installed to   minimize fluid leakage at this point. </p>
                  <p>This valve stem uses <term>Acme Threads</term>, a thread type with no points, just below   the point where the <term>hand-wheel</term> is installed. The valve stem threads engage the   internal threads of the <em>yolk bushing</em>, which is made from a softer material than   the valve stem, e.g. bronze, brass etc. If the stem has too much rotational force   applied, the yoke bushing threads strip instead of the valve stem threads. The yoke   bushing is a replaceable part and is screwed into the upper part of the bonnet with   machine threads. When the valve hand-wheel is turned in the clockwise direction, the   valve stem threads engaged with the yoke bushing threads cause the stem to move inward   pushing the disk toward the seat closing the valve. </p>
                  <p>The upper part of the bonnet on this particular valve is split into two supporting   uprights from the area where the packing gland is installed to the location of the yoke   bushing. This type of upper bonnet design is called an outside yolk and stem. </p>
               </paragraphs>
               <paragraphs>
                  <title>Installation</title>
                  <p>Globe valves are normally installed with the incoming fluid pressure applied to the   bottom of the valve disk, that is, to the side of the disk that closes against the seat.   The top of the disk is the side that does not close against the seat and, in most globe   valves, is the side in contact with the valve stem. When fluid pressure is applied to   the bottom of the disk, the pressure helps the operator open the valve, and the pressure   on the valve packing is relieved when the valve is closed. </p>
                  <p>The only time a globe valve is installed with fluid pressure applied to the top of the   disk is when the valve is used as a throttle valve controlling steam flow to an engine.   Installed in this manner, if the disk were to become detached from the stem, the disk   would be carried toward the seat by the steam flow. Even if the disk does not close   tightly against the seat, it would choke off steam flow to the engine and cause it to   slow down. Globe throttle valves installed in this manner are considered fail safe. If   the valve was installed with the steam pressure on the bottom of the disk, and the disk   became detached from the stem, the disk would be carried away from the seat by the steam   flow and cause the engine speed to rise uncontrollably. The steam would also carry the   disk toward the engine where it could enter and cause damage. </p>
                  <p>Globe valves cause a relatively large pressure drop in the fluid as it flows through   the valve. Pressure drops are caused by the friction created when the fluid changes   direction of flow through the valve. The straight globe valve, with the pipe connections   180 degrees opposite each other, has the greatest pressure drop through it due to three   to five changes in direction of fluid flow. The right angle valve has a 90 degree angle   between the inlet and outlet pipe connections and fluid flow only changes direction one   or two times, creating less pressure drop than the straight type. Globe valves are also   constructed with 45 or 60 degree angles between the stem and the outlet side of the   valve. This valve design also creates less change in direction of fluid flow, reducing   pressure drop through the valve. </p>
                  <p>A globe valve is fully open when the disk is raised ¬º of the diameter, <m>d</m>, of   the seat opening. For full flow to take place through the globe valve, the area the   fluid flows in through and the area the fluid flows out through must be equal. The inlet   area is the hole in the seat, and is equal to the area of a circle or . The fluid flows   out through the space between the top of the seat and the bottom of the disk which is   the side of a cylindrical shape. The area of the side of a cylinder is equal to the   circumference of the circle on the end of the cylinder times the height, <m>h</m> of   the cylinder . </p>

               </figure>
               <p>A gate valve, <xref ref="GateValve_png"/>, is called for when you don‚Äôt need to   regulate flow, only turn it on or off. To open a gate valve, the moving part, called the     <em>gate</em> or <em>wedge</em>, is moved across to the fluid flow path unblocking the   opening in the valve, called the <em>seat</em>. The gate is actually slid off the   surface of the seat sideways. Sliding the gate back over the seat blocks fluid flow and   closes the valve. </p>
               <p>When open, fluids follow a straight, unobstructed path through the valve creating a   minimal pressure drop across the valve. This is the principle advantage of a gate valve   over a globe valve; it has a much lower restriction to flow when fully open. </p>
               <p>Gate valves are designed to be fully open or fully closed. They should not be left   partially open to regulate fluid flow. The fluid flow under a partially open gate causes   the gate to swing back and forth. This could cause the gate to hit the seats (sometimes   called <em>chattering</em>) creating damage to the machined surfaces of the seat and   gate leading to leakage when the valve is closed. </p>
               <p>A gate valve, like a globe valve, is constructed in two basic parts, the body, and the   bonnet. </p>

                  <title>Body</title>
                  <p>Piping inlet and outlet connections are fitted to the body 180¬∞ apart  <em>only</em>,    similar to the straight globe valve. Piping connections to the body are the same as a   globe valve: threaded, flanged, etc. </p>
                  <p>The body has two seats inside facing each other. One surrounds the inlet opening and   the other the outlet opening. The distance between the seats nearest the bonnet opening   is greater than the distance between the seats at the bottom of the valve body creating   a wedge shape between them. The gate is moved down from the bonnet location between the   two seats. It has a machined surface on both sides and has a wedge shape that matches   the two seats forcing it to seal tightly against both seats when it is pushed down   between them. </p>
                  <p>The upper part of the body and sometimes the lower part of the bonnet form a large   cavity for the gate to retract into as the valve is opened. Since the gate slides off   the seats sideways, it must be moved more than the full diameter of the seat opening to   be fully open. This is why most gate valves are taller than globe valves of a comparable   size. </p>

                        <li>
                           <em>Non-rising stem, inside screw (A)</em>  The stem screws down into the valve gate as the valve is opened. In this type the stem does not rise or fall outside the valve body as the valve is opened or closed, it simply rotates. </li>
                        <li>
                           <em>Rising stem, inside screw (B)</em> The stem rises outside the valve as the valve is opened, but the stem screw operates inside the body of the valve. When operated, the valve stem in this design rises and rotates. </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>
                              <em>Rising stem, outside screw and yoke (C)</em>  The stem screw operates at the level of the hand-wheel, so the stem rises independently of the hand-wheel as the valve is opened. The valve stem rises, but does not rotate. Instead of the valve stem rotating, the hand-wheel rotates the yoke bushing pulling the stem straight up. Valve stem threads can be easily cleaned and lubricated in this design. </p>
                           <p>Outside screw and yoke design is required on gate valves when diameters exceed 3" and pressures exceed 600 psig.</p>
                        </li>
                     </ol>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notice that in both type A and B, the stem threads are exposed to the fluids flowing   through the valve. Fluids can eventually corrode the threads and fluids with solids   entrained can cause the threads to bind up and create excessive wear. </p>
                  <p>Valves with rising stems are used when it is important to know by immediate inspection   whether the valve is opened or closed. The outside screw and yoke type easily indicates   valve position due to the stem extending out beyond the center of the valve wheel when   it is open. </p>
                  <p>The non-rising type is the least likely to leak in the packing area and requires less   installation space. </p>

               <p>A check valve is a modified globe valve that allows fluid flow in one direction only,   through a pipe line and automatically stops flow in the opposite direction. A check   valve has two basic parts: the <term>body</term> which is similar to the body of a globe   valve ‚Äì with one seat, two external pipe connections, and an opening for the bonnet to   attach to; and the <term>Cover</term> or <term>Cap</term> which replaces the globe valve bonnet   assembly and fastens to the body using the same methods used to attach bonnets on globe   valves. However, the cap is a blank cover with no hand operators, stuffing box or valve   stem. </p>
               <p>There are three main variations of check valves: <term>swing checks</term>, <term>lift checks</term>, and <term>stop checks</term>, and they are discussed below. </p>
               <paragraphs>
                  <title>Swing Check</title>
                  <p>In a swing check valve the valve seat is angled 45¬∞ to the fluid flow path through the   valve. The disk is attached by an arm to a hinge pin inside the valve body near the   cover opening. The hinge pin is located just above the highest part of the seat opening.   When the fluid flow is from right to left and the pressure on the bottom of the disk is   greater than the pressure on the top of the disk, the disk swings away from the seat   allowing flow to take place. When fluid flow tries to reverse (from left to right), the   pressure on top of the disk becomes greater than the pressure on the bottom of the disk,   the disk to moves back toward the seat, preventing flow in this direction. The arm and   hinge pin assembly assure correct alignment between the disk and seat for a tight   closure. </p>

                  <title>Lift Check</title>
                  <p>A lift check valve has a specially designed disk or ball which closes against a seat   just like a typical globe valve. In this design, the disk or ball is not attached to any   arm or stem. Since the disk is free to move away from the seat without an arm or stem to   guide it back in correct alignment to the seat upon closing, other guidance means are   employed. In most lift check valves, the disk (with higher than normal sides) or the   ball just fits into to hole in the upper part of the body. When flow pushes the disk or   ball away from the seat, the walls of the hole in the upper body guide the disk or ball   straight up away from the seat. These walls also guide the disk straight down when it is   closing assuring correct alignment between the disk and seat for tight closure. </p>

               <paragraphs>
                  <title>Stop Check</title>
                  <p>A stop-check valve is very similar to a globe valve, except that the disk is not   attached to the stem. When the valve hand-wheel is turned to the fully closed position   the disk is held against the seat and the valve is securely closed. When the valve   hand-wheel is turned to open the valve, the disk is free to lift off the seat, and will   when there is a pressure difference in the correct direction. If the flow reverses   direction, the valve will automatically close like a lift check valve. </p>
                  <p>The valve stem can be used to force the disk to a partially closed position to   regulate the flow, or to a fully closed position to stop the flow, but the valve stem   cannot be used to force the disk into the open position. Once the stem is moved away   from the disk, the valve functions like a lift check valve. </p>
                  <p>A typical application would be a boiler feedwater stop-check valve. The valve can be   used to stop or regulate feedwater flow to the boiler. It also automatically prevents   the back flow of water out of the boiler through the feedwater line if the pressure in   the feedwater line falls below the boiler steam pressure. In this application, it   functions as a check valve. </p>
                  <p>In some designs, a stop-check valve can be converted to a regular globe valve, which   eliminates the check function and allows the disk to be forced into the open position,   by reinstalling the disk nut or drilling a hole through the upper disk and valve stem   and inserting a pin to lock them together. </p>
               </paragraphs>
               <p>When installing a check valve, always remember: Check valves <em>must</em> be   installed in a manner that allows gravity to help close the disk. This way the valve   will close even if the flow reversal is only slight. Swing checks are normally installed   in piping systems with the cap up, and lift checks are installed with the disks closing   in the downward direction. There is usually a directional arrow on the valve body which   indicates the direction of fluid flow. </p>

               <p>Plug-type valves have a rotating element with a hole drilled or cast through it. When   the hole lines up with the matching passages in the valve body, fluid can flow through   the valve. Variations of plug valves are pet cocks, cylinder valves or ball valves. </p>

                  <p>
                     <term>Plug valves</term>, <xref ref="plugvalve_png"/>, have a through-ported cylindrical or tapered   plug which can rotate in a close-fitting body. Alignment of the ports (holes) in the   plug with those in the body permit fluid flow. </p>
                  <p>Operation of a plug valve requires rotating the handle or lever on the plug stem 90   degrees. Normally the plug valves (for the most common type with two pipe connections   180 degrees apart) position (open or closed) can be determined by looking at the   operating lever. When the lever is parallel to the piping system, the valve is open.   When the lever is perpendicular to the piping system, the valve is closed. </p>
                  <p>Plugs valves have limited throttling ability and should be used like gate valves,   either fully open or closed. </p>
                  <p>Plug valves may be built with multiple openings in the plug and multiple ports in the   valve body. These designs allow a variety of fluid flow directions through the plug   valve by proper positioning of the operating lever. Pointers attached to the plug stem   or operating lever are sometimes used to indicate direction of flow. </p>
                  <p>When a plug valve is described as <q>three-way, two-port</q> it means the valve body   has three openings to pipe connections on the outside of the body. Two port means the   plug has two openings in it that fluid flows in and out through. </p>

                  <p>A <term>ball valve</term>, <xref ref="ball_valve_png"/>, is similar to a plug valve except that a   spherical rather than cylindrical plug is used. The ball has a hole or port bored   through it and is made tight to the two openings in the body by plastic or synthetic   rubber seat seal rings. These plastic or synthetic seat rings limit most ball valves to   fluid temperatures of 350¬∞ or less. When the ball is rotated to the closed position, the   fluid pressure pushes the ball tightly against the outlet seat ring insuring tight   closure. </p>
                  <p>Ball valves are compact, self-sealing, non-sticking, require little effort to rotate   the valve stem and they provide smooth fluid flow. Since the port in the ball is   normally the same I.D. as the piping, the ball valve offers little resistance to flow   and low pressure drop. </p>

                  <image source="pics/valves/Butterfly.png" width="50%"/>
               </figure>
               <p>
                  <term>Butterfly valves</term> can be used for on-off operation as well as throttling or regulating fluid flow. They are light weight, require little installation space, have low initial cost, are simple in design and can be easily repaired. Like plug and ball type valves, it is only necessary to rotate the valve stem a quarter turn on a butterfly valve to go from the full open to the closed position. Manual operating levers on butterfly valves are parallel to the piping when the valve is open and perpendicular to the piping when the valve is closed. 90¬∞ valve stem operation makes them very adaptable to automatic and remote control actuators. </p>
               <p>The disk in the butterfly valve is connected to the stem across its diameter. (See <xref ref="Butterfly_png"/> and <xref ref="exploded_butterfly_png"/>). When closed, the outer edge of the disk is in contact with a seat ring surrounding the opening through the valve body. To open the valve, the stem rotates the valve disk, until when fully open, the flat surfaces of the disk are parallel to the centerline of the pipe with fluid flowing past each side of the disk. </p>
               <p>The seat opening is lined with resilient, elastic materials like synthetic rubber, neoprene or Teflon. The disk edge presses into this material when closed to form a tight seal. </p>
               <figure xml:id="exploded_butterfly_png">
                  <caption>Exploded view, Butterfly valve</caption>

               </figure>
               <p>In symmetrical type butterfly valves (stem is centered on the thickness of the disk), a tight seal is a problem where the stem passes off the edge of the disk. Symmetrical butterfly valves are generally satisfactory for tightly sealing fluid leakage in fluid systems up to approximately 200 psig and 180 ¬∞F. </p>
               <p>To improve sealing, the eccentric or offset design butterfly valves are used. The stem is offset to one side of the disk so it does not interrupt the edge of the disk‚Äôs seal with seat ring. The stem may also be installed across the disk to one side of the maximum diameter. This allows a major portion of the disk‚Äôs edge to push it‚Äôs way into the seat material rather than slide into it. </p>
               <p>Offset butterfly valves seal tightly and have reasonable seat ring life up to about 700 psig with water to temperatures slightly above ambient. Pressure ratings drop with the rise in temperature with maximum temperature limits being 450 to 500 ¬∞F. </p>

               <title>Pressure Relief Valves</title>
               <p>
                  <term>Relief valves</term> are protective devices designed to open automatically when the pressure in the line unit becomes too high. Although there are different types of relief valves, the most common type has a disk that is held in the closed position by a coil spring. When the pressure in the line or machine creates a force great enough to overcome the spring force, the disk moves upward and is opened. After the pressure has been relieved by the escape of fluid through the relief valve, the spring again exerts enough force to close the disk. </p>
               <figure xml:id="crosbyHSJ_png">
                  <caption>Relief Valve</caption>
                  <image source="pics/valves/crosbyHSJ.png" width="35%"/>
               </figure>
               <p>Relief valves have no hand-wheel operator, but may be equipped with a lever attached to the valve stem which the operator can use to momentarily open the valve, in order to test that the valve can open properly, or to blow out debris such as rust or dirt, which if lodged between the disk and seat would cause the valve to leak. </p>
               <p>Relief valves are designed to work properly with any type of fluid, while safety valves are only designed to work with gases. </p>
               <p>Most relief valves are set to open when the pressure against the disk reaches 110% of the <em>Maximum Allowable Working Pressure</em> (called the MAWP) of the system or machine. For example, if a system operates with a MAWP of 100 psi, then the relief valve would open at 110 psi. </p>
               <p>Relief valves are designed to close at a pressure lower than their opening pressure (The difference between opening and closing pressure is called <em>blowdown</em>). This is done to prevent <em>valve chattering</em>, which is a rapid opening and closing of the valve. Chattering is undesirable because it can damage the seat and disk. If the valve opened and closed at exactly the same pressure, it would chatter, because as soon as it opened, the pressure would drop and cause the valve to close, and as soon as it closed the pressure would cause it to open again. </p>
               <p>Chattering is prevented by exposing an additional disk surface area to the fluid pressure immediately after the valve opens. This increased area, acted upon by the fluid pressure, increases the force against the spring, and makes the valve open rapidly once it starts to open, but it will not close again until the pressure falls significantly below the opening pressure. </p>
               <p>It must be remembered that the coil spring force acting when the valve begins to open is the same as the spring force acting when the valve closes. Since <m> F = PA </m>:  <me>P_o A_o = P_c A_c</me>  Where: <ul marker="">

            <title>Pumps</title>
            <introduction>
               <p>A  <term>pump</term> is a device used to increase the pressure and move <em>liquids</em>, such as water or oil, or <em>slurries,</em> which are mixtures of liquids and solids, through pipes. If a pump is used to move gases, it is usually referred to as a  <term>fan</term>,  <term>compressor</term>, or  <term>blower</term>. </p>
               <p>The fluid inlet to the pump is called the <term>suction</term>. Fluid flows from the suction into the pump  chamber, and then out the pump  <term>discharge</term>. While the fluid is in the pump chamber, an external power source imparts energy to the fluid in order to: <ul>
                     <li> move the fluid from a lower to a higher level </li>
                     <li> move the fluid from a lower to a higher pressure </li>
                     <li> overcome fluid friction in the passages and pipelines </li>
                  </ul>
               </p>
               <p>Most of the energy from the external power source is transformed into usable fluid <em>pressure</em>, which is a form of potential energy, or into <em>velocity</em>, which increases the kinetic energy of the fluid. The remainder of the energy is absorbed by frictional losses in the pump and fluid passages, and shows up as heat. The fluid, now at a higher energy level, is led to the pump outlet called the discharge. </p>
               <p>The external energy supplied to most pump shafts is in the form of <em>torque</em>, produced by electric motors, diesel or gas engines, or gas or steam turbines. Some pumps use a sliding, back-and-forth, external motion and are known as  reciprocating. Pressurized gas or liquid is used as an energy source to operate a  jet type pump. </p>
               <p>The  <term>capacity</term> of a pump is the volume of fluid that the pump can move (under specific operating conditions) per unit of time and is usually expressed as <q>Gallons per Minute</q> or <q>GPM</q> for short. The pressure that a pump is capable of delivering is described as the <term>pump  head</term>, and will be discussed in the next section. </p>

               <title>Head</title>
               <introduction>
                  <p>  Head is defined as the vertical distance between two liquid levels. Head, for a pump, is simply the distance, measured in <q>feet of fresh water,</q> between the pump suction connection centerline and the liquid level in the supply tank, or between the pump discharge connection centerline and the liquid level in the discharge tank. <term>Static head</term> in feet can be related to the pressure that the pump must generate in the fluid to create these differences in liquid levels. Static head also influences the output capacity of the pump. </p>
                  <p>When discussing pumps, we are always referring to  static head. In other engineering courses, you will learn about other types of head. For example, in Fluid Mechanics, you will calculate the pressure necessary to overcome friction in the pipelines, called  <term>friction head</term>, and the pressure required to impart velocity to the fluid, known as  <term>velocity head</term>. </p>
                  <figure xml:id="static_head_png">
                     <caption>Static Pump Head</caption>

                  </figure>
                  <p>Head can also be thought of as the pressure necessary to support a column of water of a height equal to the head. Since head can be related to pressure, you may be wondering how atmospheric pressure affects the pump. Usually there is no effect at all. Since atmospheric pressure acts on the surface of the liquid in both the suction and discharge tanks, the effect is equal but in opposite directions on each side of the pump, and the result is that the net effect of the atmospheric pressure on the pump, is canceled out. </p>
                  <p>Several different head measurements are used to describe the operation of a pump. The relationship between these heads is illustrated in <xref ref="static_head_png"/>. </p>
               </introduction>
               <subsubsection xml:id="suctionhead">
                  <title>Suction Head</title>
                  <p>The distance between the surface of the liquid in the supply tank and the centerline of the pump suction describes the pump <term>suction head</term>. </p>
                  <p>
                     <term>Positive suction head</term>, also called  gravity head, occurs when the liquid level in the supply tank is <em>above</em> the center of the pump suction. The height of the liquid creates a pressure on the suction side of the pump that is greater than atmospheric pressure, and gravity causes the liquid to flow into the pump suction. In this situation, very little power is required to draw the liquid into the pump. </p>
                  <p>
                     <term>Negative suction head</term>, also called  <term>suction lift</term>, occurs when the liquid level in the supply tank is <em>below</em> the center of the pump suction. In this case, the pump must create the force necessary to lift the liquid uphill against the force of gravity and draw it into the pump suction. This process obviously requires more pumping power than when there is a positive suction head. </p>
                  <p>To pump when there is a suction lift, we use the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the liquid in the supply tank to push the liquid up the pipe to the pump suction, much like sucking on a straw. If the pressure inside the suction pipe is reduced to 13.7 psia compared to the 14.7 psia on the surface of the water in the supply tank, than the water level in the suction pipe should be 2.31 feet higher than the water level in the supply tank. (remember: 1 psi = 2.31 feet of fresh water!). Now if the pressure in the suction pipe is lowered to 0 psia, the atmospheric pressure should theoretically push the water up against the force of gravity (14.7 x 2.31 = 33.96 feet) 34 feet inside the suction pipe. The suction side of the pump will be operating at a pressure lower than atmospheric (under a vacuum) when the pump is lifting. 34 feet of suction lift is the theoretical maximum for fresh water, but in the real world, the maximum suction lift is less. </p>

                     <term>Static discharge head</term> is the vertical distance above the pump, in feet, between the centerline of the discharge connection and the liquid level in the discharge tank. The greater the discharge head, the more energy will be required to pump the liquid. Also, as the discharge head is increased, the pump capacity decreases; at a certain point the discharge drops to zero GPM, and the pump is no longer pumping. </p>

                  <p>Hundreds of different types of pumps have been invented and improved over the years to meet every conceivable pumping requirement. These pumps differ in principles of operation and in design details; nevertheless, they may be broadly categorized according to their <em>displacement characteristics</em>, their <em>delivery characteristics</em>, and their <em>suction characteristics</em>. These broad categories are described in this section. </p>

                  <p>A  <term>positive displacement pump</term> is one in which a definite volume of liquid is delivered for each cycle of pump operation, regardless of the discharge pressure the pump operates against, and provided the capacity of the power unit driving the pump is not exceeded. </p>
                  <p>A <term>non-positive displacement pump</term> is one in which the volume of liquid delivered for each operational pump cycle depends on the resistance to flow in the discharge line. This type of pump produces a force on the liquid that is constant for each particular operating speed of the pump. Pressure in the discharge line produces a force in the opposite direction. When these two forces are equal, the liquid is in a state of equilibrium and does not flow. </p>
                  <p>If the discharge valve of a positive displacement pump is completely closed, the discharge pressure will rise to a point where either the unit driving the pump will stall or parts of the pump exposed to discharge pressure will fail. This situation should be avoided. On the other hand, closing the discharge valve on a non-positive displacement pump will cause the discharge pressure to rise to a maximum for that type of pump operating at a specific speed. Nothing more will happen except the pump will churn the liquid trapped in the pump chamber and produce frictional heat in the liquid. </p>
                  <p>Most positive displacement pumps deliver liquid in slugs, with no delivery in between, and this causes a rise then a drop in discharge pressure and flow. Pumps equipped with many small pumping chambers generally have overlapping delivery that minimizes this effect. Non-positive displacement pumps deliver a practically continuous even flow for a given operating speed and discharge pressure. </p>

                  <p>All shaft driven pumps will deliver liquids at different volume rates if they are run at different speeds. Most pump designs require a change in speed to change their capacity (<term>constant delivery</term>). However, some rotary type pumps, and some radial or axial piston pumps are designed to vary the quantity of liquid delivered while maintaining the prime mover at a single speed. Pumps with these characteristics are known as  <term>variable delivery</term> pumps. </p>
                  <p>Variable delivery pumps are most commonly found in hydraulic systems, where the delivery rate can be adjusted to control the rate of motion of hydraulic cylinders and actuators. </p>

                  <title>By Suction Characteristics</title>
                  <p>Some types of pumps are designed with such close clearances between moving and stationary parts in the pump chamber that they will actually pump air, gases, or vapors as well as liquids. These pumps can be started with no liquid in the pump chamber and will pump the air out of the suction pipe, lowering the pressure, eventually causing the liquid to lift up and enter the pump. These types of pumps are considered to be  <term>self-priming</term>. </p>
                  <p>Other types of pumps, because of larger internal clearances, will not pump air or gases and will not lower the pressure in the suction pipe enough to lift the liquid to the pump chamber. These types of pumps must have the suction pipe and the pump chamber completely flooded with the liquid to be pumped or they will not lift the liquid. Filling the suction pipe and pump chamber with liquid to place these pumps in operation is called  <term>priming</term> the pump. </p>

                  <title>Centrifugal Pumps</title>
                  <p>
                     <term>Centrifugal pumps</term> use centrifugal force to transfer the mechanical energy supplied to the pump into primarily kinetic energy (velocity) in the fluid being pumped. Centrifugal force is the force generated by rotation which acts outward from the center of rotation. Using the terminology already covered, centrifugal pumps are classified as:  non-positive displacement pumps,  non-self priming, and are  constant delivery for a given operating speed and discharge pressure. Because of their simplicity, low cost and ability to operate under a wide variety of conditions, centrifugal pumps are widely used. They can be adapted to produce any head up to several thousand feet and will handle liquids at temperatures up to 1000¬∞ F. They can also be designed to handle liquids containing a high proportion of rather large solid particles. </p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>A centrifugal pump consists of a rotating element called the  <term>impeller</term>, which is the only moving part in the pump, and a specially shaped housing, or pump  casing. In practically all centrifugal pumps, liquid enters the rotating element at the center through the  <term>eye</term>, and is given a rotary motion in the pump chamber by the rotation of a number of impeller blades (generally called  <term>vanes</term>). The rotation of the impeller in a true centrifugal pump does two things. Centrifugal force drives the liquid directly out from the center of the impeller, setting up a greater pressure in the chamber at the outer edge of the impeller than at the eye. At the same time the liquid is also pushed around and around by the turning of the vanes, and is given more and more velocity as it moves farther out from the eye. The liquid finally leaves the impeller tangentially at the end of the vanes with a high velocity, and flows into the discharge passage of the pump housing surrounding the impeller. </p>
                  <p>The discharge passage gradually widens as it leads the liquid away from the impeller to the discharge nozzle on the pump housing. The gradual widening of the discharge passage reduces the velocity of the liquid. Since the reduction in velocity does not produce work, it results in a change in the type of energy contained in the liquid. Most of the velocity (kinetic energy) in the liquid produced by the centrifugal pump is transformed into pressure (potential energy) by the widening discharge passage. This type of energy is more available for doing work. On most centrifugal pumps this widening passage is built into the pump casing that surrounds the impeller and is called the  <term>volute</term>. Additional conversion of velocity to pressure may be accomplished in the <term>discharge nozzle</term> and sometimes in the piping leading away from the pump. </p>
                  <p>Recall that a reduction in the velocity of a liquid (without producing any work) changes the type of energy contained in the liquid into increased pressure. The reverse is also true. If the pressure in a liquid is reduced (without producing any work) then the velocity of the liquid must increase.) </p>
                  <p>When liquid is forced away from the eye by centrifugal force, a reduced pressure area is created in the eye causing more liquid to flow in. This creates a constant flow through the impeller and out through the discharge of the centrifugal pump. </p>
                  <p>In a centrifugal pump, the velocity that can be imparted to the liquid, and the resulting discharge pressure depends upon both the impeller diameter and the impeller RPM. Increasing either results in: <ul>
                        <li> higher centrifugal force </li>
                        <li> higher liquid velocity </li>
                        <li> higher pressure </li>
                     </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>The centrifugal pump, with a certain size impeller operating at a set speed, will only put enough energy in the liquid to create a specific discharge pressure. If the resistance in the discharge piping rises to the maximum pressure the pump can create, liquid flow through the pump stops. The centrifugal pump is said to be operating at its  shut-off head and no liquid is delivered by the pump. Friction between the rotating impeller and the liquid trapped in the pump casing increases the liquid temperature, possibly causing it to vaporize. To prevent vaporization of the liquid in a high speed centrifugal pump handling very hot liquids, a small pipeline is installed on the discharge side of the pump to divert a small amount of liquid back to the supply tank on the suction side of the pump. This small quantity of liquid flowing through the pump acts as a cooling system constantly removing the heated liquid from the pump casing and replacing it with cooler liquid from the supply tank. These lines are called  recirculating lines and are always found on shipboard turbine-driven centrifugal feed pumps because they are frequently subjected to shut-off head when the ship‚Äôs main engine is stopped or maneuvering. </p>
                  <p>Impeller vanes which curve backwards with respect to their direction of rotation are more efficient and give better performance than straight vanes; however, the pump must be turned in the correct direction to obtain this efficiency. The advantage of straight vane impellers is that they have the same efficiency in either direction of pump rotation. In <xref ref="centpump_png"/>, the impeller rotation is counter-clockwise allowing the liquid to be pushed around the pump chamber by the vanes, rather than being carried by them. If a curved vane impeller was operated in the wrong direction rotation, it would still deliver some liquid, but the following would be observed: <ul>
                        <li> The pump would require more power to turn the impellor backwards. </li>
                        <li> The pump discharge capacity would decrease. </li>
                        <li> The pump efficiency would decrease. </li>
                     </ul>

                     <title>Centrifugal Pump Design</title>
                     <p>Centrifugal pumps come in two basic designs, <term>volute</term> and <term>diffuser</term>, and many variations, including: <term>single</term>- or <term>double-suction</term>, single or multiple stages, and horizontal or vertical layout. </p>
                     <p>In the  <term>volute pump</term>, the one most commonly used, the impeller discharges into a progressively expanding casing, as shown in <xref ref="centpump_png"/>. The casing is proportioned to produce equal velocity of flow all around the circumference of the casing and then gradually to reduce the velocity as the liquid passes from the casing into the nozzle to be discharged from the pump, thereby transforming a considerable part of the velocity head into pressure head. </p>
                     <figure xml:id="diffusertype_png">
                        <caption>Diffuser Type Centrifugal Pump</caption>
                        <image source="pics/pumps/diffusertype.png" width="50%"/>
                     </figure>
                     <p>In the  <term>diffuser pump</term>, the impeller is surrounded by gradually expanding passages formed by stationary guide vanes, sometimes called a diffusion ring, as shown in <xref ref="diffusertype_png"/>. In these expanding passages the direction of flow is changed and velocity largely converted to pressure before the liquid enters the volute. It is worth noting that the diffuser vanes are set approximately tangent to the ends of the impeller blades. In this kind of casing, efficiency may be slightly higher than in volute pumps, since velocity is more completely converted into pressure. The added cost of manufacture and more complicated construction of diffuser pumps, however, is generally not considered justified except occasionally in the case of large high pressure pumps. </p>
                     <figure xml:id="impellers_png">
                        <caption>Impellers</caption>
                        <image source="pics/pumps/impellers.png" width="50%"/>
                     </figure>
                     <p>The impellers used in volute and diffuser pumps are of three kinds, <em>open</em>, <em>semi-open</em>, and <em>enclosed</em> as shown in <xref ref="impellers_png"/>. The open impeller consists only of blades attached to a hub. The semi-open impeller is constructed with a circular plate, called the web, on the inside edge of the blades. The web need not extend all the way out to the ends of the blades. The use of a web makes it possible to use thinner blades. In the case of the enclosed impeller, a shroud is added on the outside edge of the blades, so that the liquid is in large measure confined in the blade region, between the web and the shroud. Holding the liquid between these plates reduces friction losses in the pump. Open and semi-open impellers are normally found in pumps that must handle relatively large solids in the liquid, such as sewage pumps. </p>
                     <p>Impellers may also be  single or  double-suction. The former consists of a single impeller drawing liquid in from one side through one eye, while the double suction impeller is similar to a pair of single suction impellers placed back to back, placing an eye on each side of the impeller so that the liquid is drawn into the impeller from opposite directions. Double suction impellers can handle greater capacities of liquid than a single suction impeller of the same size and operating speed. This is because the larger inlet area of the two suction eyes provides less resistance to liquid flow into the impeller. </p>
                     <figure xml:id="doublesuction_png">
                        <caption>Double Suction Pump</caption>

                     </figure>
                     <p>
                        <term>Single stage pumps</term> contain only one impeller, drawing in the liquid and expelling it through the discharge into the liquid system. A double-suction, single-stage pump is shown in <xref ref="doublesuction_png"/>. A disadvantage of the single-stage pump, however, is that discharge pressure cannot be increased above the maximum working pressure of the impeller design operating at a given speed. Above this limit, under practical working conditions, the pump will not deliver any further increase in pressure. Most volute type, single stage pumps do not operate at speeds in excess of 3600 RPM and typically produce maximum discharge pressures in the 150 to 200 psi range. Diffuser type, single stage pumps may operate at speeds as high as 8000 RPM and produce discharge pressures in excess of 1000 psi; turbine driven boiler feed pumps are sometimes this type. </p>
                     <p>In <term> multistage pumps</term>, this disadvantage is overcome by combining several single-stage pumps, whether single or double suction, so that the discharge of one impeller is delivered to the suction of the next impeller. The liquid is delivered to each succeeding stage under the pressure imparted to it by the preceding stage, and additional velocity and pressure are added. As the liquid passes through each impeller in turn, additional pressure is imparted to it. A much higher working head can be produced than is possible with a single impeller. For the sake of compactness the several impellers of multistage pumps are almost invariably placed on one shaft, and the whole unit is built into one housing. The impellers are arranged in multistage pumps to eliminate or minimize end thrust. </p>
                     <p>Both volute and diffuser pumps will be found in single and multi-stage construction. Because of the greater cost and complexity of diffuser pumps, they are rarely used. </p>
                     <p>The pump itself can have a <em>vertical</em> or <em>horizontal</em> layout, determined by the direction of the pump shaft axis when the pump is installed. Horizontal designs, in most applications, are easier for maintenance personnel to work on, while vertical designs require less floor space for installation. Both designs work equally well. </p>

                  <title>Reciprocating Pumps</title>
                  <p>In <term>reciprocating pumps</term>, a power source drives a piston or plunger back and forth in a cylinder. This action pushes liquid out into the discharge on the discharge stroke, and draws liquid into the cylinder, from the source of supply, on the suction stroke. For each stroke, the same quantity of liquid enters and leaves the cylinder. The fluid flow through the pump is controlled by two check valves, one in the suction line and the other in the discharge line of the pump. </p>
                  <p>
                     <xref ref="recip_pump_png"/> shows a steam driven reciprocating pump. The steam piston (7) is driven up and down by steam, delivering power to the liquid piston, or   (69), which pumps the liquid. When the liquid piston (69) is moved down, the area above the piston is on a suction stroke. As the piston moves down in cylinder (72), the increase in cylinder volume causes a decrease in cylinder pressure. When the pressure in the cylinder drops below atmospheric pressure (creating a vacuum in the cylinder), the atmospheric pressure on the liquid in the suction tank forces the liquid up the suction pipe, through suction valve (85) and into the cylinder. Atmospheric pressure plus the liquid pressure in the discharge pipe create a pressure higher than the pressure in the cylinder. This holds the discharge valve (84) closed. When the piston begins to move up on the discharge stroke, a decrease in cylinder volume occurs, attempting to compress the liquid. This results in an increase in liquid pressure in the cylinder. As soon as the cylinder pressure exceeds the pressure in the suction pipe, the suction valve (85) is forced closed. As the piston continues to move up, the liquid pressure in the cylinder continues to rise. When the liquid pressure in the cylinder exceeds the pressure in the discharge pipe, the discharge valve (84) opens and fluid flows from the cylinder into the discharge line. This process repeated many times can build up a considerable discharge head (pressure) on the discharge side of the pump. </p>

                  <title>Rotary Pumps</title>
                  <p>All the many varieties of <term>rotary pumps</term> operate on the same principle. An element called the   is rotated in the pump chamber in such a way that the liquid is carried or pushed from the suction side of the pump to the discharge side. </p>
                  <p>Rotary pumps are positive displacement, since they deliver a fixed quantity of liquid for each operational cycle or revolution of the pump shaft. This means that they want to move liquid even when the pump discharge is blocked. If the discharge of a rotary pump were closed with the pump operating, and if no pressure relief valve was installed in the pump discharge line, pressure would build up till the shaft seal failed, the electric motor overloaded and stopped, the engine driving the pump stalled, the pump casing or discharge piping ruptured, or some other casualty resulted. </p>
                  <p>When a rotary pump is operating at a constant speed, the amount of liquid delivered to the discharge line decreases slightly as the discharge pressure working against the pump increases. The drop in discharge capacity is due to increased internal leakage through the close clearances between stationary and moving parts in the pump housing. As the discharge pressure increases, the leakage rate from the discharge to the suction side of the pump, through the internal clearances, increases. This internal leakage reduces the pump‚Äôs discharge capacity, and is known as  </p>
                  <p>There are dozens of designs for the rotors of rotary pumps. Gears may be used as in <xref ref="gear_pump_png"/>, but with almost any number of teeth, and in a variety of forms; elements that look like gears may be employed, although one of the pair may not be capable of rotating the other; two, three, or more lobes may be used; screws may be used which carry the liquid through the pump in their hollowed-out channels; sliding or swinging vanes may be used which form a seal with the walls of the chamber because they are pushed from the center of the rotor by mechanical arrangements or are thrown out by centrifugal force; small pistons moving in and out from the center of the rotor may be used to push liquid through the pump; and there are still more varieties. A few representative designs of rotary pumps will be described in the following sections. </p>

                        <term>Gear pumps</term> are probably the most common type of rotary pump, and <xref ref="gear_pump_png"/> illustrates a typical example. The liquid is carried from the suction to the discharge in the spaces between the gear teeth and the surface of the pump casing as the gears rotate. One of the gears is directly driven by the source of power, while the other, called the   rotates with it in the opposite direction. This is accomplished either because motion is imparted from the drive gear to the idler gear by the meshing of the two gears at the center of the pump chamber, or because   outside the pump chamber transmit motion from one gear shaft to the other. </p>
                     <p>There are close clearances between the gear teeth and the pump casing, and between the teeth of the two gears at their point of contact where they form a continuous fluid-tight joint. As the gears rotate in the direction indicated by the arrows, liquid is trapped in turn between each pair of teeth and the casing and carried away from the suction side of the pump. At the same time, as the teeth un-mesh at the center of the pump chamber, a low pressure is left in the empty space between the gear teeth. Liquid flows in to fill the low pressure areas between the gear teeth. As the gear teeth re-mesh on the discharge side of the pump, the liquid in between the gear teeth is forced out, eventually flowing to the discharge connection on the pump casing. </p>
                     <p>Three kinds of true gears are used: <term>spur</term>, <term>helical</term> and <term>herringbone</term>. Spur and helical gear pumps can be rotated in the opposite direction to reverse the flow through the pump while generally that is not possible with the herringbone design. When the latter is rotated in the wrong direction, liquid is trapped in the middle of the <q>V</q> resulting in pressure strains on the shafts and bearings. </p>
                     <p>The herringbone gear pump utilizes gears with a very steep <q>V</q> shape to the gear teeth. These designs are employed when very smooth discharge is desired. The steep angle on the gear teeth, however; prevents the gear driven by an outside source from turning the idler gear. The steep angle causes the gear teeth to jam together rather than rotate freely. Rotary motion is transmitted to the idler shaft via a set of timing gears instead. The timing gears prevent driving contact between pumping gears to eliminate the jamming problem. </p>

                     <p>In an internal gear system, the teeth of one gear project outwards , but the teeth of the other gear project inwards toward the center of the gear as shown in <xref ref="internal_gear_png"/>. One gear stands inside the other in the internal gear pump. A gear directly attached to the drive shaft of the pump is set off-center in a circular chamber fitted around its circumference with the spurs of an internal gear. The two gears mesh on one side of the pump chamber, between the suction and discharge. On the opposite side of the chamber a crescent shaped form (a stationary part of the pump) stands in the space between the two gears in such a way as to provide a close clearance with them. </p>
                     <p>The rotation of the central gear by the shaft causes the outside gear to rotate, since the two are in mesh. Everything in the chamber rotates except the crescent, causing the liquid to be trapped in the gear spaces as they pass the crescent. This liquid is carried from the suction to the discharge, where it is forced out of the pump by the re-meshing of the gear teeth. As liquid is carried away from the suction side of the pump, the pressure is lowered and more liquid is drawn in. </p>
                     <p>The direction of flow through this type of pump can be reversed by rotating the crescent (and the pump cover it is attached to) 180 degrees. </p>

                     <p>The <term>gerotor</term> mechanism consists of pair of gear shaped elements, one within the other, mounted in a pump chamber, see <xref ref="gerotor_png"/>. The inner gear is directly connected to the drive shaft and the source of power, and drives the outer gear through direct contact. The inner gear has one fewer teeth than the outer gear. The tooth form of each gear is related to that of the other in such a way that each tooth of the inner gear is always in sliding contact with the surface of the outer gear. Each meshing pair of teeth only fully engages at one point, 12 o‚Äôclock in the figure above. </p>
                     <p>On one side of the point of mesh, pockets of increasing size are formed as the gears rotate (suction pockets), while the pockets on the other side decrease in size (discharge pockets). </p>

The other screws, generally called  , have their shafts turned by timing gears or by direct contact between the intermeshing screw threads. </p>

                        <term>Lobe pumps </term>operate on the same principle as gear pumps. There are two rotors turning in the pump chamber operating through timing gears on the shafts outside the pump chamber. Most rotors are fitted with two to three lobes (similar to large gear teeth) to push fluid from the suction to the discharge side of the pump. Although the design will handle both liquids or gases, they are more commonly found pumping gases. A common application is an air pump to supply or increase the air flow to diesel and gasoline engines as part of the system necessary to make them run or increase the horsepower of the engine. In most cases they are considered high volume, low pressure pumps. </p>

                     <title>Vane Pumps</title>
                     <p>In  <term>vane pumps</term>, the rotor is fitted with a number of slots into which movable vanes are installed. The pump chamber is larger in diameter than the rotor and the rotor is offset in the pump chamber so that they almost come in contact with each other at the 12 o‚Äôclock position and are separated by some distance at the 6 o‚Äôclock position. As the rotor revolves, the vanes are thrown out by centrifugal force to bear against the inside surface of the pump chamber. (Liquid pressure behind the vanes also pushes them in contact with the chamber wall and sometimes springs are used behind the vanes to force them against the chamber wall) As the rotor turns from the 12 o‚Äôclock position to the 6 o‚Äôclock position, it moves away from the chamber wall and liquid flows into the space between the moving vanes. From approximately the 5 o‚Äôclock to the 7 o‚Äôclock position, the liquid is trapped between two vanes, the rotor and the chamber wall and is pushed to the discharge side of the pump. As the rotor revolves back to the 12 o‚Äôclock position, the space between the rotor and the chamber wall decreases, forcing the liquid to the discharge connection on the pump casing. Different designs of vanes may be used, as shown in <xref ref="vane_png"/>, but the sliding vane type is most common. </p>

            <title>Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams</title>
            <p>A  P&amp;ID, which stands for "Piping and Instrumentation Diagram," is a detailed schematic diagram that represents a process system using graphical symbols to show the piping, equipment, instrumentation, and control devices involved.  P&amp;IDs are commonly used in various industries, including chemical processing, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, power generation, and many others. They serve several important purposes:</p>
            <p>1. **Process Visualization:**  P&amp;IDs provide a visual representation of a complex process system, making it easier for engineers, operators, and other stakeholders to understand the system's components and how they interact.</p>
            <p>2. **Design and Engineering:**  P&amp;IDs are essential during the design and engineering phases of a project. Engineers use them to plan and design process systems, including the layout of pipes, equipment, and instrumentation.</p>
            <p>3. **Communication:**  P&amp;IDs act as a universal language in engineering. They help facilitate communication among different teams, such as engineers, designers, operators, and maintenance personnel, by providing a clear and standardized way to discuss and document the process.</p>
            <p>4. **Safety:**  P&amp;IDs play a critical role in ensuring safety. They show safety devices, relief valves, and emergency shutdown systems, helping to identify potential hazards and safety measures.</p>
            <p>5. **Maintenance and Troubleshooting:** During operation,  P&amp;IDs are valuable for maintenance and troubleshooting. They enable personnel to identify components, valves, instruments, and their locations quickly.</p>
            <p>Typically,  P&amp;IDs include various elements:</p>
            <p>- **Pipes and Lines:** Piping and conduit lines are represented by lines with specific line types (e.g., solid lines for process lines, dashed lines for utility lines).</p>
            <p>- **Equipment:** Equipment such as pumps, compressors, tanks, heat exchangers, and reactors are depicted using standardized symbols.</p>
            <p>- **Instruments:** Instruments such as sensors, controllers, and recorders are represented by symbols that indicate their function and type.</p>
            <p>- **Valves and Control Valves:** Different types of valves and control valves are shown with symbols that indicate their operation and control functions.</p>
            <p>- **Control Loops:** These are used to represent the control systems and feedback loops within the process.</p>
            <p>- **Safety Devices:** Safety features like relief valves, pressure safety valves, and emergency shutdown systems are depicted.</p>
            <p>- **Annotations and Labels:**  P&amp;IDs include labels, tags, and annotations that provide additional information, such as equipment names, pipe sizes, flow rates, and other relevant data.</p>
            <p>Creating and reading  P&amp;IDs is a specialized skill, and professionals known as process engineers or piping and instrumentation designers are typically responsible for their creation and interpretation.  P&amp;IDs are crucial documents for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of complex industrial processes and systems.</p>

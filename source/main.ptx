         <title>Electricity</title>
         <p>
            <term>Voltage</term>, or <em>electric potential difference</em>, is a fundamental concept in electricity.  Voltage  is measured in units of volts (V), and symbolized as <m>V</m>.  Voltage can be seen as the <q>push</q> or<q>force</q> that propels electric charges within a circuit. When voltage is applied to a circuit, it creates an electric field that influences the movement of charged particles, resulting in the establishment of an electric current. In simpler terms, voltage serves as the driving force behind the flow of electric charges in an electrical system.</p>
         <p>Voltage can be produced through several methods, including <em>chemical reactions</em> (such as in batteries) and the <em>photovoltaic effect</em> (as in solar cells). However, the most important method of is <term>electromagnetic induction</term>.  Electromagnetic induction is the process where a changing magnetic field induces (creates) an electric voltage in a nearby conductor.   This phenomenon is the basis for generating electricity in devices like generators and transformers.  Electrical generators will be described in more detail in <xref provisional="generators"/>
         </p>
         <p>
            <term>Current</term> refers to the flow of electric charge in an electrical circuit. It is the rate at which electric charges, typically electrons, move through a <term>conductor</term>. Current is measured in amperes (A) and is represented by the symbol <m>I</m>. It can be thought of as the quantity of charge passing through a point in a circuit per unit of time. The flow of current occurs when there is a potential difference (voltage) applied across a conductor, providing the driving force for the movement of electric charges.</p>
         <p>
            <term>Resistance</term> is a property of a material or component in an electrical circuit that opposes the flow of electric current. It is measured in ohms (Ω) and is denoted by the symbol <m>R</m>. Resistance determines the extent to which a material or device hinders the flow of electrical charge. When a voltage is applied across a conductor, the resistance restricts the flow of current, resulting in a decrease in the magnitude of the current. Materials with high resistance impede the flow of electricity more than materials with low resistance. The resistance of a component depends on factors such as its length, cross-sectional area, and the material it is made of.</p>
         <p>
            <term>Ohm’s law</term> describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. According to Ohm's Law, the current flowing through a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage across it and inversely proportional to the resistance of the circuit. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as <me>I = V/R</me>  where: <ul marker="">
               <li>
                  <m>I</m> is the the current in amperes</li>
               <li>
                  <m>V</m> is the voltage in volts, and </li>
               <li>
                  <m>R</m> is the resistance in ohms (Ω). </li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>In other words, an increase in voltage leads to a corresponding increase in current if the resistance remains constant, while an increase in resistance results in a decrease in current for a given voltage.</p>
         <p>An <term>electrical circuit</term> is a complete loop or path that allows for the regulated flow of electric current to power devices and carry out different tasks. It consists of different elements like voltage sources, switches, and electrical loads that are interconnected through wires. <term>Electrical loads</term> refer to devices that consume electrical energy and convert it into another form like mechanical work, light, or heat.   Motors, light bulbs and heating elements are some common examples of electrical loads.  </p>
         <p>
            <term>Series Circuit</term>: In a series circuit, the components are connected in a single path such that the same current flows through each component. The components are connected end-to-end, creating a sequential circuit. In a series circuit, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, and the total voltage across the circuit is divided among the components. If one component fails or is disconnected, the entire circuit is broken, and the flow of current stops.</p>
         <p>
            <term>Parallel Circui</term>t: In a parallel circuit, the components are connected in multiple paths, allowing the current to divide and flow through different branches simultaneously. Each component in a parallel circuit has the same voltage across it. The total current in the circuit is divided among the branches based on the resistance of each branch. If one component fails or is disconnected in a parallel circuit, the current can still flow through the remaining branches.</p>
         <p>In summary, a series circuit has components connected in a single path with the same current flowing through each component, while a parallel circuit has components connected in multiple paths, allowing current to divide among the branches.</p>

         <title>Electrical Propulsion</title>
         <introduction>
            <p>Marine electric propulsion systems utilize generators to provide power for electric motors, which in turn drive the ship's propeller. The electric generators may be driven by any suitable prime mover, most commonly, diesel engines. While it may initially seem counterintuitive to interpose complex and costly equipment between the prime mover and the propeller when a simple line shaft and gearbox could transmit the power instead, there are valid justifications for the added complexity and expense. </p>
            <p>The advantages of electric propulsion are as follows:</p>
            <paragraphs>
               <title>Layout Flexibility</title>
               <p>One notable advantage of electric propulsion is the ability to install the prime mover in any convenient location, without being restricted to a direct line with the propeller. Power is transmitted through flexible cable runs, as opposed to rigid line shafts. Furthermore, instead of relying on a single large main engine, multiple smaller engines can be used, allowing for placement in smaller spaces and more convenient locations.	</p>

            <paragraphs>
               <title>Efficient operation</title>
               <p>Electric propulsion systems enable both the prime mover and the propeller to operate at their optimal speeds, eliminating the need for reduction gears. Typically, medium speed diesel engines are coupled with low-speed motors and propellers. The speed reduction is accomplished by selecting the appropriate number of motor poles, and the shaft speed (RPM) is established by adjusting the electrical frequency to the motor. This setup allows each component to operate within its most efficient range, maximizing overall energy efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
               <title>Economical Part-Load Operation</title>
               <p>By employing multiple generators operating in parallel, ships can secure one or more engines under reduced load conditions. The remaining engines can then operate at nearly full load, resulting in improved efficiency compared to having more engines operating at part-load. Load management systems continuously monitor the electrical demand and promptly initiate the startup of an additional generator when necessary.</p>

            <paragraphs>
               <title>Redundancy and Reliability</title>
               <p>	Electric propulsion systems provide inherent redundancy and enhanced reliability compared to traditional propulsion systems. With multiple smaller generator sets, the system can continue to function even if one or more generators or motors fail or require maintenance. This redundancy  reduces the risk of complete propulsion failure and ensures that the propulsion system remains operational. </p>

               <title>Principle of Operation</title>
               <p>An electrical generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy by utilizing the principle of <term>electromagnetic induction</term>.   Electromagnetic induction was first discovered in the early 19th century by English scientist Michael Faraday (1791 <ndash/> 1867). According to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, a moving or changing magnetic field induces an electric voltage in a nearby conductor. If the conductor forms a closed loop, an electric current will flow and electrical power will be transmitted.</p>
               <p>An electrical generator consists of two main mechanical components: a rotating part called the <term>rotor</term> and a stationary part called the <term>stator</term>, and two main electrical components: the <term>armature</term> and the <term>field</term>.  Both the armature and the field are made of a conducting material, usually copper wire, wound into multi-loop coils called <term>windings</term>. The rotor is connected to a prime mover, such as a steam turbine or a diesel engine which supplies the mechanical energy to the generator.</p>
               <p>The <term>field windings</term> are like an electromagnet.  When direct current (DC) flows through the field windings, a magnetic field is created similar to the one which surrounds the north and south poles of an ordinary magnet, but adjustable. The strength of the field is controlled by the amount of the field current.  The process of supplying electrical current to the field winding is known as <term>excitation</term>.  </p>
               <p>The <term>armature windings</term> are the part of the generator where the voltage is induced.  The armature consists of several individual windings connected in a specific configuration. The end points of the armature windings are called the generator <term>terminals</term>.  As long as the generator is spinning, the field will induce a sinusoidal AC voltage into the armature windings.  The armature windings deliver power to the terminals and thence to the load circuit.</p>
               <p>The induced voltage is proportional to the speed of rotation and also the strength of the magnetic field, therefore the output voltage can be adjusted by controlling the excitation current. The frequency in Hz (cycles/sec) depends on the speed of rotation and the number of magnetic poles. <me> f = \frac{P \;n }{120}</me> where <ul marker="">
                     <li>
                        <m>f</m> = frequency</li>

                        <m>n</m>= speed </li>

                        <m>P</m> = number of north/south pole pairs</li>
                  </ul>
               </p>
               <p>The induced voltage is typically generated at a fixed frequency, such as 60 Hz in the United States.</p>
               <p>In a typical AC synchronous generator, the rotor carries the field windings and the stator carries the armature windings, however the opposite arrangement is also possible. To generate three-phase power, the stator is fitted with three armature windings arranged symmetrically, 120 degrees apart from each other. As the rotor rotates, the rotating magnetic field induces voltages into each stator winding in turn, generating three sine waves of voltage, equally spaced, shown in <xref ref="three-phase"/>. </p>

               <p>As discussed in the previous section the primary components of an AC generator are the armature and the field, one of which is located on the rotor and the other on the stator.  However a practical generator requires  many other components, including an enclosure, bearings, cooling, lubrication, instrumentation and control, and a method to excite the field.  </p>

               <p>The generator main shaft (6) is driven by a 16 cylinder, 4-stroke, 4,200 kW diesel engine at 900 rpm, not shown.  </p>
               <p>The shaft is supported by two journal bearings (7 and 13), one on the drive end (DE) and the other on the non-drive end (NDE).  These bearings have an integral oil sump with sight glass, cooling fins, and an oil ring that circulates the oil to the top of the shaft as it rotates. </p>
               <p>The shaft itself supports and carries the rotating components: primarily the main rotor core (9) and main field windings (3), but also a cooling fan (2) and several other components (10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 19) that are required to excite the generator.  These components will be discussed in <xref ref="Excitation"/>. </p>
               <p>Generators produce lots of heat while they are operating due to unavoidable losses caused by mechanical friction and electrical resistance, among others.  If this heat is not removed as it is produced, the generator temperature will rise to unacceptable limits, and high temperature is extremely damaging to electrical insulation. Electrical machines are designed to run for 100,000 hours or more when operated at or below their design temperature limit, however for every 10° C rise above this temperature, the thermal life expectancy of the electrical insulation is reduced by half, so generator cooling is critical.</p>
               <p>The generator’s cooling system consists the shaft driven internal fan (2) which circulates the air through the machine to cool it. This warmed air passes over a water-cooled heat exchanger where it is cooled and then recirculated. </p>
               <p>The cooling water tubes are double walled with slotted plate fins. Water flows through the inner tube and cools the outer tube and the slotted fins. Air flows between the fins and around the outer tubes and so is cooled.  </p>
               <p>In the case of a tube leak,  water will flow between the inner and outer tubes to a leak detector and trigger an alarm.  This prevents water from leaking on to the electrical components.</p>
               <p>If for some reason the cooling water is not available, an  emergency cooling mode is available.  In this mode  cover plates on the generator are removed which allows the fan to draw cool air from the engine room and discharge the heated air back. </p>

               <p>The pilot generator is used to supply current to the exciter field, making the main generator <term>separately excited</term>, as opposed to <term>self excited</term>, where the output of the main generator itself is used to supply power to the the exciter generator. The AC output voltage of the pilot generator varies with the rotor speed, however its output current is automatically adjusted by an Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) to maintain its rated output (terminal) voltage, regardless of the load changes. </p>
               <p>The pilot generator consists of stator and rotor part as shown in <xref ref="exciter_exploded"/> and <xrer ref="pilot_generator"/>.  The rotor part carries sixteen permanent magnets bolted on the shaft with alternating polarities making this a <term>Permanent Magnet Generator</term> (PMG).  The stator part is bolted on the bearing housing of non drive-end side of the generator and carries 3-phase wye-connected armature windings.  The rotating magnets induce an AC voltage into the armature windings and three-phase rectifier attached to the stator converts the AC voltage to a DC voltage.  </p>
               <p>The resulting DC voltage is used to create a stationary magnetic field in the exciter.  In other words, the pilot generator excites the exciter, which in turn excites the main generator. </p>



The Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG) supplies&#x2028;high frequency AC power to the voltage regulator.&#x2028;The voltage regulator receives voltage and reactive current feedback provided by potential and current transformers to provide voltage and reactive current feedback. Comparing these signals to a reference set- point in the voltage regulator, the voltage regulator provides a controlled variable DC current to the stationary field of the rotating exciter. With its stationary field and rotating armature, the exciter generates three phase high frequency AC output. This output is rectified by the rotating rectifiers. This DC current is fed via conductors to the center of the rotor shaft and carried by a special lead bar in the hollow shaft area under the bearing journal which is then applied to the main generator field winding.

The rotating rectifier is a three phase full wave diode bridge. 100% diode redundancy provides 100% of full rating with a diode out of service.

         <title>Electrical Propulsion</title>
         <introduction>
            <p>Marine electric propulsion systems utilize generators to provide power for electric motors, which in turn drive the ship's propeller. The electric generators may be driven by any suitable prime mover, most commonly, diesel engines. While it may initially seem counterintuitive to interpose complex and costly equipment between the prime mover and the propeller when a simple line shaft and gearbox could transmit the power instead, there are valid justifications for the added complexity and expense. </p>
            <p>The advantages of electric propulsion are as follows: <ul>
                  <li>
                     <title>Layout Flexibility</title>
                     <p>One notable advantage of electric propulsion is the ability to install the prime mover in any convenient location, without being restricted to a direct line with the propeller. Power is transmitted through flexible cable runs, as opposed to rigid line shafts. Furthermore, instead of relying on a single large main engine, multiple smaller engines can be used, allowing for placement in smaller spaces and more convenient locations.	</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <title>Efficient operation</title>
                     <p>Electric propulsion systems enable both the prime mover and the propeller to operate at their optimal speeds, eliminating the need for reduction gears. Typically, medium speed diesel engines are coupled with low-speed motors and propellers. The speed reduction is accomplished by selecting the appropriate number of motor poles, and the shaft speed (RPM) is established by adjusting the electrical frequency to the motor. This setup allows each component to operate within its most efficient range, maximizing overall energy efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <title>Economical Part-Load Operation</title>
                     <p>By employing multiple generators operating in parallel, ships can secure one or more engines under reduced load conditions. The remaining engines can then operate at nearly full load, resulting in improved efficiency compared to having more engines operating at part-load. Load management systems continuously monitor the electrical demand and promptly initiate the startup of an additional generator when necessary.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <title>Redundancy and Reliability</title>
                     <p>Electric propulsion systems provide inherent redundancy and enhanced reliability compared to traditional propulsion systems. With multiple smaller generator sets, the system can continue to function even if one or more generators or motors fail or require maintenance. This redundancy  reduces the risk of complete propulsion failure and ensures that the propulsion system remains operational. </p>
                  </li>
               </ul>

            <title>Propulsion Converters</title>
            <introduction>
               <p>The ship’s propulsion converters are used to convert the fixed 6,600 V, 60 Hz of the vessel’s main  power supply into a variable voltage and frequency that is used to drive the two electric propulsion motors. </p>
               <p>The converters (also called <term>VFDs</term> for <term>variable frequency drive</term>) take AC from the main switchboard, and first convert it to DC via rectification, then use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) techniques to synthesize an AC sine wave that has the voltage and frequency required to drive the propulsion motor at the desired speed. The voltage and frequency of the sine wave determine the torque, speed, and direction of the motor. </p>
               <p>The converters use <term>Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors </term>(<term>IGBT</term>s) to form the output sine wave. The IGBTs are power semiconductor devices used basically as an fast electronic switches.</p>

                  <p>A press pack IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) refers to a type of power semiconductor device that is commonly used in high-power applications, including motor drives, power converters, and industrial equipment. It is designed to handle large currents and voltages.</p>
                  <p>The term "press pack" refers to the physical packaging of the IGBT. It consists of a semiconductor chip, typically made of silicon, along with its associated control and protection circuitry. The chip is mounted between two metal plates, which serve as electrical contacts and provide mechanical support. These plates are typically made of materials such as copper or aluminum.</p>
                  <p>The press pack design allows for efficient heat dissipation, as the metal plates can be directly attached to a heat sink to dissipate heat generated during operation. This ensures that the IGBT can handle high-power applications without overheating.</p>
                  <p>Press pack IGBTs are known for their robustness, reliability, and high current-carrying capability. They are widely used in industries where high-power switching and control are required, such as electric propulsion systems, renewable energy systems, and industrial motor drives.</p>

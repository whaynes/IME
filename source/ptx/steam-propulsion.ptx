   <title>Steam Propulsion</title>
   <introduction>
      <p>Over the last 50 or so years steam and steam turbines as a means of ship propulsion have been supplanted by low and medium speed diesel engines, mainly because motor ships have better fuel efficiency, are easier to automate, requires less maintenance, and can be operated with smaller crews <mdash/> all factors leading to lower operating costs <mdash/> than steam ships. Nevertheless, steam propulsion remains important, because steam power is still used extensively in industry and power generation ashore, and the skills of a steam engineer find high demand in the shoreside job market.</p>
      <p>In this chapter we will discuss the basics of marine steam propulsion and the steam cycle. The steam cycle is the thermodynamic process which marine engineers use to transform the energy contained in the ship’s fuel oil or <em>bunkers</em> into the power to turn the ship’s propeller and supply all the other requirements necessary to move a steamship from one point to another. </p>
      <p>We will begin with a discussion of a very simplified version of the steam cycle, which nevertheless illustrates all its important principles. Then, we will progress to a more detailed, practical, and efficient version of the cycle, which more closely represents the cycle used on real steamships. The function of each of the components of the cycle will be briefly described here, but you will learn much more about them in your <em>Steam Generator</em>, <em>Steam and Gas Turbines</em>, and <em>Thermodynamics</em> classes.</p>

      <title>The Generation of Steam</title>
      <p>When a liquid boils, it generates a vapor, that is, some or all of the liquid changes its physical state from liquid to gas (or vapor). As long as the vapor is in contact with the liquid from which it is being generated, it remains at the same temperature as the boiling liquid. In this condition, the liquid and its vapor are said to be in <em>equilibrium contact</em> with each other. </p>
      <p>The temperature at which a boiling liquid and its vapor may exist in equilibrium contact depends on the pressure under which the process takes place. As the pressure increases, the boiling temperature increases. As the pressure decreases, the boiling temperature decreases. For each liquid, therefore, the boiling point is determined by the pressure. </p>
      <p>When a liquid is boiling and generating vapor, the liquid is called a <em>saturated liquid</em>, and the vapor is called a <em>saturated vapor</em>. The temperature at which a liquid boils under a given pressure is called the <em>saturation temperature</em>, and the corresponding pressure is called the <em>saturation pressure</em>. For each pressure there is a corresponding saturation temperature, and for each temperature there is a corresponding saturation pressure. A few saturation pressures and temperatures for water are listed below. </p>
      <p>Atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia at sea level and lesser at higher altitudes. Trying to cook potatoes at the top of a high mountain takes a great deal longer than it would at sea level. Why is this? As noted before, temperature and pressure are indications of internal energy. Since it is not possible to raise the temperature of the boiling water above the saturation temperature for that pressure, the amount of internal energy available for cooking the potatoes is much less at high altitudes than it is at sea level. By the same line of reasoning, you should be able to figure out why the potatoes cook faster in a pressure cooker than in an open kettle. </p>
      <p>A peculiar thing happens to water and steam at an absolute pressure of 3206.2 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature at 705.40 °F. At this point, which is called the <em>critical point,</em> the vapor and the liquid are indistinguishable. No change of state occurs when the pressure is increased above this point or when heat is added. At the critical point, we can no longer refer to <q>water</q> or <q>steam,</q> since we cannot tell the water and steam apart. Instead, the substance is merely called a <q>fluid</q> or a <q>working substance.</q> Boilers designed to operate at pressures and temperatures above the critical point are called <em>supercritical</em> boilers. Supercritical boilers are not used, at present, in propulsion plants of ships; however, some boilers of this type are used in stationary steam power plants. </p>
      <p>If we generate steam by boiling water in an open pan at atmospheric pressure, the water and the steam which is in immediate contact with the water will remain at 212 °F until all the water has been evaporated. If we fit an absolutely tight cover to the pan, so that no steam can escape while we continue to add heat, both the pressure and the temperature inside the vessel will rise. The steam and water will both increase in temperature and pressure, and each fluid will be at the same temperature and pressure as the other. </p>
      <p>In operation, a boiler is neither an open vessel nor a closed vessel. Instead, it is a vessel designed with restricted openings which allow steam to escape at a uniform rate while feedwater is being brought in at a uniform rate. After boiler operating pressure has been reached, therefore, the process of steam generation in a boiler takes place at constant pressure and constant temperature, if we disregard any fluctuations that may be caused by changes in steam demands. </p>
      <p>Although it is impossible to raise the temperature of the steam in the steam drum above the temperature of the water from which it is being generated, we can raise the temperature of the steam if we first remove the steam from contact with the water inside the steam drum and then add heat. Steam which has been heated above its saturation temperature for any given pressure is called <em>superheated steam</em>, and the vessel in which the saturated steam is superheated is called a <em>superheater.</em>The amount by which the temperature of the superheated steam exceeds the temperature of saturated steam at the same pressure is known as the <em>degree of superheat</em>. For example, if saturated steam at a pressure of 620 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature of 490 °F is superheated to 790 °F, the degree of superheat is 300 °F. </p>
      <p>All ship’s propulsion boilers are equipped with superheaters. The primary advantage is that superheating the steam provides a greater temperature differential between the boiler and the condenser, thus allowing more heat to be converted to work at the turbines. Another advantage is that superheated steam is dry and therefore causes relatively little corrosion or erosion of machinery and piping. Also, superheated steam does not conduct heat as rapidly (and therefore does not lose heat as rapidly) as saturated steam. The increased efficiency which results from the use of superheated steam reduces the amount of fuel oil required to generate each pound of steam, and so reduces the space and weight requirements for the boilers. </p>
      <p>It should be noted, however, that most auxiliary machinery is designed to operate on saturated steam. Reciprocating machinery in particular requires saturated steam for the lubrication of internal moving parts of the steam end. Ship’s boilers, therefore, are designed to produce both saturated steam and superheated steam. </p>

      <title>Basic Steam Cycle</title>
      <introduction>
         <p>
            <xref ref="simplified_png"/> shows a very simplified version of the steam cycle, which is an appropriate starting point for our discussion of ship’s propulsion.</p>
         <p>The steam cycle is an example of what is known by engineers as a <term>cyclic heat engine</term>. It is called <em>cyclic</em>, because it operates on a cycle. It uses a working fluid, water, which travels from point to point through the cycle, changing form and carrying energy, but eventually returning to the starting point restored to the same state that it started with. It is called a <em>heat engine</em>, because it transforms <em>heat</em>, which is a form of energy, into <em>work</em>, another form of energy. The thermodynamic name for this cycle is the <term>Rankine Cycle</term>.</p>
         <figure xml:id="simplified_png">

            <image source="images/simplified.png"/>
         </figure>
         <p>The four stages of the steam cycle will be described, and then the cycle will be described again, this times from the perspective of the Rankine Cycle.</p>
      </introduction>
      <subsection xml:id="generation">
         <title>Generation</title>
         <p>Since this is a cycle, it has no beginning or end, but <em>we</em> have to start somewhere, so let’s begin with the generation stage.</p>
         <p>Steam generation occurs in the boiler. The boiler is simply a device used to boil water. Like a tea-kettle on the stove, it contains liquid water and a heat source. As the water is heated, its temperature rises and soon it begins to boil. On the stove, the water vapor or steam rises and dissipates into the kitchen, but not so in a boiler. The boiler is a closed vessel, like a pot with a lid, and any steam generated in the boiler rises to the top and is collected before being sent on to the next step of the cycle.</p>
         <p>In the generation stage, the chemical energy stored in the ship’s fuel is released when the fuel is burned in the boiler furnace, and some of this energy is transferred to the working fluid – the water. The water gains energy, and we can detect this in two ways: the water’s temperature goes up, and the water changes <em>state</em> from a liquid into water vapor, which we call steam. Steam leaves the boiler at high pressure and high temperature.</p>
         <p>As we will learn in <xref ref="thermodynamics"/>, heat energy which raises the temperature of a substance such as water or steam is sometimes called <term>sensible heat</term> while the heat energy that actually boils the substance is called <term>latent heat</term>.</p>
         <p>You probably remember that water boils at 212 °F at standard atmospheric pressure (14.7 psia). If you put a thermometer into a pan of water boiling on the stove, this is what it will read. Even if you turn the flame up to add more heat energy, you won’t be able to make the water temperature rise above 212 °F. This is because you are adding latent heat, which is not reflected by an increase in the water’s temperature. All of the heat energy is being used to turn the liquid water into a vapor.</p>
         <p>The boiling or condensing temperature of a liquid is known as its <term>saturation temperature</term>. The saturation temperature for a particular liquid is determined by its pressure, and cannot be changed. For example, 212 °F is the saturation temperature for water at atmospheric pressure, and there is nothing anybody can do to change it.</p>
         <p>In order to reach high steam temperatures, which is necessary for high steam cycle efficiency, the boiler must be operated at a pressure far above atmospheric pressure. A typical marine boiler operates at about 600 psi while some have operated as high as 1200 psi, although this introduces additional maintenance difficulties. Shoreside steam power plants operate at 3000 psi or even higher.</p>
         <p>Steam temperature is raised even further by <term>superheating</term> the steam. Superheating steam raises its temperature above the saturation temperature for the corresponding steam pressure by continuing to add heat to the steam after it has completely vaporized. This must take place in a separate area, called the <em>superheater,</em> away from liquid water, or the additional heat would simply boil more water rather than superheating the steam. Superheated steam is said to be <em>dry</em>, which means that all liquid water has vaporized and it contains no moisture droplets. Drops of liquid water would damage the turbine in the expansion step described below.</p>
         <p>Improving efficiency is a major concern of mechanical and marine engineers. High efficiency means that fuel is not wasted, and operating costs are minimized. Practical boiler designs incorporate many techniques to maximize efficiency. For example, not all of the chemical energy originally contained by the fuel ends up transferred to the steam. A large portion of this energy is lost up the smokestack, carried away by the combustion gases. Practical boilers usually contain some sort of heat exchanger in the smokestack in an effort to recover some of this energy.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="expansion">
         <title>Expansion</title>
         <p>The thermal energy added to the working fluid in the generation stage is converted to mechanical energy, or work, in the expansion stage. This work is produced in the form of a rotating turbine shaft which drives the propeller and moves the ship through the water. The more energy we can remove at this stage, the higher the efficiency of the steam cycle. Unfortunately, it is not possible to remove all the energy from the steam in the turbine. Some energy remains in the steam and is carried to the next stage of the cycle.</p>
         <p>A <term>turbine</term> is the device used to accomplish the energy transformation in the expansion stage. Like a pinwheel or a fan, a turbine has a freely rotating shaft with many carefully designed <term>turbine blades</term> attached. However, unlike a fan, the turbine rotor is completely enclosed in a casing which also contains <term>nozzles</term> and <term>stationary blades</term> designed to direct the steam towards the <term>rotating blades</term>.</p>
         <figure xml:id="fig_turbine_blades">
            <caption>  Turbine Blades  </caption>
            <image width="50%" source="images/turbine_blades.png">
               <remix>  Intro to Steam book </remix>
            </image>
         </figure>
         <p>High-pressure, high-temperature steam passes through the nozzle, which has a very small opening, and it emerges with a high velocity. The thermal energy of the steam is converted into mechanical kinetic energy in the nozzle. This high velocity steam jet hits the blades and imparts a turning torque to the rotor shaft and converts its kinetic energy to rotational kinetic energy of the shaft. Most turbines have several rows of blades, forming multiple stages to extract the maximum energy from the steam. As the steam gives up its thermal energy, its temperature and pressure both drop. The steam leaves the turbine at a low temperature and low pressure.</p>
         <p>High steam pressure at the inlet to the turbine is important for energy conversion, but it is equally important to have a low pressure at the turbine outlet. Steam, or any fluid for that matter, will only flow from high pressure to lower pressure. Without a pressure drop across the blades of the turbine, there would be no steam flow, and no energy conversion. To maximize the energy conversion, we must also maximize the pressure drop across the turbine.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="condensation">
         <title>Condensation</title>
         <p>As stated previously, a large pressure drop across the turbine is required to get maximum energy extraction from the steam. The boiler supplies the high pressure at the inlet to the turbine, it is the job of the condenser to create a low pressure condition at the turbine outlet.</p>
         <p>The condenser is a shell-and-tube heat exchanger cooled by seawater. It consists of a large, rectangular or cylindrical sealed shell containing thousands of tubes. A circulating pump forces cold seawater in at one end, through the tubes, and it exits overboard at the other end. Steam exiting from the turbine enters the condenser at the top, condenses on the tube surfaces and drains out the bottom. That is, the steam gives up its latent heat of condensation to the seawater, and returns to the liquid water state. Once the steam passes across the condenser tubes, it is no longer steam. It has condensed to liquid water, and from this point in the cycle is referred to as <term>condensate</term>. Condensate leaves the condenser as a low temperature, low pressure liquid.</p>
         <p>Because the condensation is occurring at approximately the temperature of the seawater, the pressure in the condenser will be approximately equal to the saturation pressure of steam at this temperature, assuming that no air or other gases are present. For example, if the seawater temperature is 80 °F, the corresponding saturation pressure would be 0.5073 psia. This is a very high vacuum, and the greater the vacuum, the better the plant efficiency.</p>
         <p>The latent heat removed from the steam by the seawater raises the temperature and increases the energy contained by the seawater, and this cooling water is discharged overboard.</p>
         <p>It is unfortunate that some of the energy once contained by the fuel, and then passed on to the steam in the boiler, is eventually thrown away with the seawater. Wouldn’t it be better to somehow use this energy to power the ship? Absolutely, but there is nothing we can do about it! The only way to extract more energy from the steam is by having the turbine discharge to an even lower absolute pressure than we do. The only way to do that is to condense the steam at even lower temperatures than we are. But we can’t do that, because aboard ship there’s nothing colder than the surrounding ocean available to reject the heat to. If we decided not to reject any heat to the ocean at all, the pressure in the condenser would build up to the point where it would equal the steam pressure entering the turbine, and without a pressure drop, the steam would stop flowing altogether. There’s no win, but we’re doing the best we can.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="recovery">
         <title>Recovery</title>
         <p>The only thing that remains to complete the cycle is to return the condensate to the boiler to be heated up again. Unfortunately, the condensate leaving the condenser is at a low pressure and the boiler operates at a much higher pressure. Condensate won’t flow back into the boiler by itself. A pump is required to raise the pressure and return the condensate to the boiler.</p>
         <p>The pump, known as the <term>feed pump</term>, draws condensate from the condenser discharge, raises its pressure slightly above the boiler pressure, and discharges it back into the boiler to restart the cycle. Condensate leaving the feed pump is known as <term>feedwater</term>.</p>
         <p>Work is required to drive the feed pump, and this energy reduces the net work produced by the cycle and available to turn the shaft. Fortunately, since water is incompressible it takes much less work to raise its pressure back to the boiler pressure than we get from an equivalent pressure drop across the turbine, and so there is a net positive amount of work produced by the cycle.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="t-sdiagram">
         <title>Rankine Cycle</title>
         <p>The diagram shown in <xref ref="ts_diagram_fig"/> is an idealized representation of the <term>Rankine Cycle</term> used in the study of thermodynamics, and known as a <term>temperature-entropy diagram</term>. The heavy dome shaped curve is known as the <term>vapor dome</term> and points under the curve are saturated steam, while points to the left of the curve are liquid water and points to the right of the curve are superheated steam.</p>
         <p>Feedwater enters the boiler at point <m>1</m>, and is heated by the fuel. Initially, the water temperature rises, until it reaches the saturation temperature for the boiler pressure, point <m>1_f</m>, where the water begins to boil. Additional heat added at this point does not raise the temperature any further until all the liquid water is completely vaporized, point <m>1_g</m>. The heat added between <m>1_f</m> and <m>1_g</m> is the <term>Latent Heat of Vaporization</term>. After the steam has reached point <m>1_g</m>, any additional heat added causes the temperature to rise again, and the steam becomes superheated.</p>

         <p>Superheated steam leaves the boiler at point <m>2</m> and enters the turbine. During the expansion process, the steam pressure and temperature both drop as energy is extracted from the steam. Steam leaves the turbine and enters the condenser at point <m>3</m>, which is saturated or wet steam.</p>
         <p>In the condenser, heat is removed from the steam and it returns to the liquid state at point <m>4</m>. The feed pump raises the water pressure back up to the boiler pressure and the cycle begins again at point <m>1</m>. The feed pump causes a small temperature rise in the feedwater as well as a pressure increase.</p>
         <p>The area under the curve from <m>1</m> to <m>2</m> represents the heat energy added in the boiler and the area under the curve from <m>3</m> to <m>4</m> represents the heat rejected to the ocean. The area inside the curve represents the net work done by the cycle.</p>

      <title>Steam Propulsion System</title>
      <introduction>
         <p>While the simplified steam cycle discussed in the previous section could be built, and it would work, several modifications are required to make it practical for steam propulsion and to improve its efficiency. </p>
         <p>The actual steam cycle that was used for propulsion on MMA’s old ship <em>TS Kennedy</em>  is shown in <xref ref="main_steam_cycle_fig"/>. Each of the components of this cycle will be briefly discussed in the following sections, in its order in the cycle.</p>

      </introduction>
      <subsection xml:id="boiler">
         <title>Boiler</title>
         <p>Heat energy is added to the cycle by burning fuel oil in the boiler. The high temperature flames raise the temperature of the water in the boiler and eventually cause it to boil. Not all energy of the fuel is transferred to the water, some remains in the combustion gases and travels up the stack. This energy will be lost to the atmosphere unless it is recovered by economizers or air heaters located in the exhaust path. Any heat energy lost to the atmosphere represents waste and steam cycle inefficiency.</p>
         <p>
            <term>Marine boilers</term> supply the steam required for propulsion, as well as any other steam requirements of the vessel. Marine propulsion boilers are normally fired with heavy fuel oil, or in a few cases today, coal.  Marine boilers, while similar to boilers found ashore, are designed to meet the particular requirements of shipboard use. They are designed to be light and compact to fit into small engine rooms, capable of operating under rapidly changing loads when the vessel is maneuvering, and to operate reliably while the vessel is pitching and rolling during a storm. </p>
         <figure xml:id="sg-0008_png">

            <image source="images/sg-0008.png"/>
         </figure>
         <p>Diesel and gas turbine powered ships are often equipped with smaller <term>auxiliary boilers</term> to supply the steam for quarters and cargo cargo heating, <etc/>  The heat source for auxiliary boilers can be fuel oil, diesel oil, or the waste heat from the main propulsion diesel engine. </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="steamdrum">
         <title>Steam Drum</title>
         <p>The <term>steam drum</term> is located near the top of the boiler and should normally be half filled with water and the remainder filled with steam. A <term>gage glass</term> on the steam drum allows the operator to determine the water level in the boiler. Too little water would be very dangerous, because without water in the boiler the heat of the flames would melt the boiler tubes and destroy the boiler.</p>
         <p>Steam is formed in the boiler tubes, and since steam bubbles are less dense than the surrounding liquid water, they float up to the top of the boiler and eventually rise above the surface of the water in the steam drum. If the steam was allowed to build up in the drum, the boiler pressure would quickly rise, and if not relieved by the safety valves, would cause the boiler to explode. The system is designed to remove steam as quickly as it is created, so a properly operated boiler will maintain a constant pressure.</p>
         <figure xml:id="steam_drum_fig">
            <caption>Steam Drum</caption>
            <image source="images/steam_drum.png" width="60%"/>
         </figure>
         <p>A steam drum <term>safety valve</term> is located on top of the steam drum to prevent boiler explosions. This valve will open automatically to relieve the steam pressure up the stack if it rises too high.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="drypipe">
         <title>Dry Pipe</title>
         <p>The <term>dry pipe</term> is located inside the steam drum, near the top. In its simplest form the dry pipe is simply a pipe with holes drilled into the top portion. Steam enters the dry pipe before it leaves the boiler.</p>
         <p>The dry pipe is designed to allow steam to enter, but to exclude water droplets and moisture. Moisture in the steam, known as <term>carryover</term>  is bad, because high velocity water droplets in the steam can cause damage to the blades and thrust bearings in the turbine. Improper operation of the boiler, for instance letting the steam drum water level get too high, can cause carryover.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="superhtr">
         <title>Superheater</title>
         <p>Steam collected in the dry pipe is directed to the <term>superheater</term> section of the boiler, where it is <term>superheated</term> to improve the efficiency of the steam cycle.</p>
         <p>Water boils at a particular temperature which is determined by the pressure of the surroundings called the <term>saturation temperature</term>.  For example, water at atmospheric pressure always boils at 212 °F, while water at 600 psia always boils at 486 °F.   The saturation temperature for water at a given temperature can be looked up in <term>steam tables</term>.</p>
         <p>Steam temperature can be raised above the saturation temperature by adding additional more heat energy, but this must occur in an area where there is no liquid water present, or the heat would simply boil more water and would not raise the temperature.</p>
         <p>This heating occurs in the superheater, which is a bank of boiler tubes located in the hottest portions of the combustion gas path. Since there is no liquid water in the superheater, all heat added there produces superheat.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="mainsteamstopvalve">
         <title>Stop Valves</title>
         <p>No practical boiler could function without valves. Valves permit the operator to control fluid flow, and to isolate sections of the system for maintenance. There are dozens of valves used in the main steam cycle but in this discussion we will only mention a few of them. You may assume that valves are located throughout the system wherever they are necessary.</p>
         <p>The <term>main steam stop valve</term> is located at the outlet of the superheater, and it is the primary valve used to connect or isolate the boiler from the remainder of the steam cycle.</p>
         <p>According to US Coast Guard regulations, boilers are required to have <term>two valve protection</term>, that is, they are required to have two valves in series in all boiler connections. This insures that at least one valve will be functional when the time comes to secure the boiler.  The valve which provides this protection is called the <term>bulkhead stop valve</term>.  It is located in the main steam line, downstream of the main steam stop valve.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="strainer">
         <title>Strainer</title>
         <p>A <term>steam strainer</term> is placed in the steam line upstream of the main engine to prevent objects other than steam from entering the turbines, since solid objects impacting the turbine blades would quickly destroy them. Steam lines would normally be expected to be quite clean, but a strainer is cheap insurance against nuts, tools, and gloves left in the lines by shipyard workers, or rust flakes formed during a layup period. Unfortunately, water droplets due to wet steam or carryover will pass through the steam strainer.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="throttles">
         <title>Throttles</title>
         <p>The <term>throttle valves</term> are used to throttle (control) the amount of steam allowed to enter the turbines, and hence they control the speed of the ship. On the <em>TS Kennedy</em>, the throttle valves were manually opened and closed by the engineer on watch but on more modern ships they are remotely operated from the bridge.</p>
         <p>There are two throttles, the <term>ahead throttle</term>, and the <term>astern throttle</term>. The ahead throttle controls steam to the high pressure turbine and controls the speed of the ship in the ahead (forward) direction. If the ahead throttle is closed, and the astern throttle is opened, steam will be directed to the astern section of the low pressure turbine and the turbine will rotate in the reverse direction.</p>
         <p>The ahead and the astern throttles should not be opened at the same time, because this would cause two opposing torques on the low pressure turbine rotor. While this would not necessarily be damaging, it would be a colossal waste of energy. The <term>Astern Guardian Valve</term> is installed in the astern steam line between the astern throttle and the astern turbine to protect against leakage of the astern throttle while the ship is underway. This valve normally remains closed, and is only opened when the ship is expected to maneuver.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="hpturbine">
         <title>Turbines</title>
         <p>The simplified steam cycle uses a single turbine to extract power from the steam, but most ships use two turbines to do the same job. Two shorter turbine shafts are more advantageous than one large shaft for several reasons, including reduced manufacturing cost and increased flexibility in the arrangement of machinery in the engine room.</p>
         <p>The first of these two turbines is known as the <term>high pressure turbine</term> (HP) and the second is the  <term>low pressure turbine</term>  (LP). A steam line, called the <term>crossover</term> carries steam from the outlet of the HP turbine to the inlet of the LP turbine. A set of <term>reduction gears</term> are used to reduce the turbine speed to the shaft and propellor speed.</p>

         <p>Superheated steam from the throttles enters the HP turbine where its pressure drops and its thermal energy is converted to mechanical energy. The LP turbine follows the HP turbine and continues to extract energy from the steam. The steam enters at a low pressure (a vacuum actually, at low loads) and exits at an even lower pressure into the main condenser. The specific volume of steam at these low pressures is large, which means that the turbine blades and the LP turbine itself are also large. When looking at the two turbines, it is always easy to identify the LP turbine because of its size; eight to ten feet in diameter is not unusual.</p>
         <p>The forward end of the LP Turbine rotor contains the <term>Astern Elements</term>. These are two or three rows of blades designed to rotate the shaft in the astern direction. Since there are so few rows of astern blades, the power the turbine is capable of producing in the astern direction is limited.</p>
         <p>The HP and LP turbines and the reduction gear together are known as the <term>Main Engine</term>.</p>

         <title>Main Condenser</title>
         <p>As stated before, the <term>main condenser</term> is a shell and tube heat exchanger which provides the low pressure zone for the turbine to discharge into. A typical main condensers consists of three main parts: the <term>shell</term>, the <term>tubes</term>, and the <term>tube sheets</term>. Cold sea water enters the shell at the inlet water head or water box, flows across the condenser through the tubes, and is discharged overboardThe steam entering the condenser turns back to liquid water when it comes in contact with the cold condenser tubes. The newly formed condensate drains down to the bottom of the condenser, where it collects in the <term>hot well</term> until it is pumped out.</p>
         <p>In order to maintain high plant efficiency it is necessary to maintain a good vacuum in the main condenser. This vacuum is formed by the collapse of the steam as it condenses, since the specific volume of water is so much less than the specific volume of steam. A properly operating main condenser operates at 28.5 in Hg vacuum or greater.</p>
         <p>Vacuum will be maintained in the condenser as long as the shell of the condenser does not fill up with air or other gases, however vacuum tends to draw air into the condenser through any available leaks, such as those found at the <term>turbine glands</term> where the turbine shafts penetrate the turbine casing. This air must be pumped back out to the atmosphere as fast as it leaks in, or else vacuum will be lost. This is accomplished with a steam driven pump known as the <term>air ejector</term> which takes suction on top of the main condenser and discharges air to the engine room.</p>
         <p>Vacuum will also be lost if condensing stops. This could happen if the supply of cooling water through the condenser tubes was interrupted, perhaps due to failure of the main circulating pump, blocked condenser tubes, or if the condensate pump failed which would cause the condenser to fill up with condensate.</p>

      <subsection xml:id="condensatepump">
         <title>Condensate pump</title>
         <p>At this point in the simplified cycle, you will find a feed pump to return the condensate back to the boiler. In an actual cycle you will find a number of additional items which are installed to increase the efficiency of the steam cycle by adding essentially <em>free</em> energy to the working fluid.</p>
         <p>The first new item is the <term>condensate pump</term>, which is a centrifugal pump that takes suction on the condenser hot well and raises the condensate pressure enough to move it on to the DC heater. The condensate pump must pump from a vacuum, which is a difficult job for a pump. It is important to properly vent and seal the pump, or it will not pump well.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="airejectorcondenser">
         <title>Heat Exchangers</title>
         <p>Following the condensate pump, condensate passes through a series of heat exchangers designed recover otherwise lost heat energy and improve the efficiency of the steam cycle.</p>
         <p>First the condensate passes through the <term>Air Ejector Condenser</term>.  The <term>Air Ejector</term> is a steam powered air pump that removes air that leaks into the condenser.  The steam used by the air ejector is condensed here, where it preheats the condensate. Any heat added before the condensate reaches the boiler represents fuel that doesn’t need to be burned, so the cycle efficiency is raised. </p>
         <figure xml:id="air_ejector_fig">

            <image width="75%" source="images/air_ejector"/>
         </figure>
         <p>Next, the condensate passes through <term>gland exhaust condenser</term>. This unit condenses steam that leaks out of the turbine glands, and simultaneously recovers more energy and recaptures the leakage. This is an example of the way a practical cycle takes every opportunity to recover <q>free</q> energy and increase the overall cycle efficiency</p>
         <p>The <term>drain cooler</term> and <term>first stage heater</term> follow, in that order.   The first stage heater uses partially expanded steam to pre-heat the condensate.  This steam condenses in the first stage heater, but still is quite hot, so the remaining energy is recovered in the drain cooler. The condensed drains are returned to the system so no water is lost.</p>
         <p>The first stage heater is an example of  <term>regenerative feed heating</term>, a process that improves the overall efficiency of the cycle. In regenerative heating, steam is partially expanded in the turbine to drive the propeller, then bled off at an appropriate temperature where it is used to preheat the condensate. Some shore power plants have four or more stages of regenerative heating.</p>
         <p>The flow order through these heat exchangers is always from coolest to hottest. Therefore the air ejector and exhaust condensers come first, followed by the drain cooler, and finally the first stage heater.</p>

         <title>DC Heater</title>
         <p>The first stage heater is followed by the second stage heater, which is usually referred to as the <term>DC Heater</term>.  The DC Heater is the point in the steam cycle where <em>condensate</em> becomes <em>feed water</em>. </p>
         <p>The DC heater provides a second stage of regenerative feed heating, which is accomplished by mixing low pressure steam directly with the condensate.  In other words, the heat exchange occurs by <term>direct contact</term>, hence the name.   The DC Heater is also sometimes called <em>deaerating feed tank</em>, the <em>DFT</em>, the <em>deaerator</em>, as well as the <em>second stage heater</em>. All these names refer to the same piece of equipment. </p>

         <p>The DC Heater serves three important functions in the steam cycle:</p>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Heat </title>
            <p>The first function of the DC Heater is to heat the feedwater prior to returning it to the boiler. Thermodynamically, it is known as the regenerative second stage heater. Using the exhaust steam from steam powered auxiliaries to heat the DC Heater increases the overall plant efficiency and saves fuel.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Deaerate </title>
            <p>The second function of the DC Heater is to remove dissolved gases (oxygen and free carbon dioxide) from the condensate and make-up water used for boiler feed. Removal of oxygen and free carbon dioxide protects piping and pumps, as well as boilers and condensate return lines from these corrosive gases.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Store </title>
            <p>Finally the DC Heater acts as a storage location for feedwater. It acts as a surge tank for the system, allowing fluctuations in the amount of water contained in the cycle to occur without upsetting the feed pump and feedwater regulators. </p>

      <subsection xml:id="feedpump">
         <title>Feed Pump</title>
         <p>The feed pump serves the same purpose here as it does in the simplified cycle; that is, it raises the pressure of the feedwater sufficiently to force it into the boiler to begin the cycle again.</p>
         <p>The feed pump is usually a turbine driven centrifugal pump, and the discharge pressure is about 50 to 100 psi above the pressure in the steam drum.</p>

      <subsection xml:id="feedvalves">
         <title>Feed Valves</title>
         <p>Three valves in the feed line before the boiler are used to control the flow of feedwater into the boiler.</p>
         <p>The  <term>feed check valve</term> comes first. It is a stop-check valve which is normally left open, but which can be used to regulate the feed water flow to the boiler if necessary. The feed check valve is always fitted with a reach rod or other means to permit it to be manually operated from the boiler control station.</p>
         <p>The feed check is followed by the<term> feed water regulator </term>which is an automatic, pneumatically actuated regulating valve that responds to changes in boiler drum level and steam demand to automatically maintain a constant water level half-way up the steam drum.</p>
         <p>The final valve of the set is the <term>feed stop valve</term>. This valve is provided to permit the feed system to be secured at the boiler when necessary.</p>

         <title>Economizer</title>
         <p>After the feedwater enters the boiler it passes through the <term>economizer</term>.</p>
         <p>The economizer is a heat recovery device. It consists of a finned-tube heat exchanger which captures the heat in the boiler exhaust gases before they pass up the stack and uses it to heat the feedwater. This is the final effort to improve the efficiency of the steam cycle, by recovering heat energy that would otherwise be lost.</p>
         <p>After leaving the economizer the feedwater enters the steam drum where the generation stage occurs, where the steam cycle begins again.</p>

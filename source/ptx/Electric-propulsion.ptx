   <title>Electric Propulsion</title>
   <introduction>
      <p>Marine electric propulsion systems utilize generators to provide power for electric motors, which in turn drive the ship's propeller. The electric generators may be driven by any suitable prime mover, most commonly, diesel engines. While it may initially seem counterintuitive to interpose complex and costly equipment between the prime mover and the propeller when a simple line shaft and gearbox could transmit the power instead, there are valid justifications for the added complexity and expense. </p>
      <p>
          The advantages of electric propulsion include:
          <ul>
            <li>
               <title>Layout Flexibility</title>
               <p>The ability to install the prime mover in any convenient location, without being restricted to a direct line with the propeller. Power is transmitted through flexible cable runs, as opposed to rigid line shafts. Furthermore, instead of relying on a single large main engine, multiple smaller engines can be used, allowing for placement in smaller spaces and more convenient locations.	</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <title>Efficient Operation</title>
               <p>Eliminating the need for reduction gears. Typically, diesel engines and steam turbines operate most efficiently at high or medium speeds, while propellors are most efficient at low speed, below about 100 RPM.  When propulsion power is supplied electrically, speed reduction is accomplished by selecting the appropriate number of poles in the generator and varying the electrical frequency supplied to the motor. This setup allows each component to operate within its most efficient range, maximizing overall energy efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <title>Redundancy and Reliability</title>
               <p>Inherent redundancy and enhanced reliability compared to traditional propulsion systems. With multiple smaller generator sets, the system can continue to function even if one or more generators or motors fail or require maintenance. This redundancy  reduces the risk of complete propulsion failure and ensures that the propulsion system remains operational. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <title>Economical Part-Load Operation</title>
               <p>Improved efficiency at low loads. Ships can secure one or more engine/generator sets if they are not needed. The remaining engines can then operate at nearly full load, resulting in improved efficiency compared to having more engines operating at part-load. Load management systems continuously monitor the electrical demand and promptly initiate the startup of an additional generator when necessary.</p>

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>An overview of the electric propulsion system of the <em>Patriot State II</em> is shown in the one-line diagram below, <xref ref="propulsion_system"/>.</p>
      <p>Electrical power for both propulsion and ship’s services is produced by four Hyundai HSJ9 913-08P diesel driven generators.    These are 6600 Volt, three-phase AC synchronous generators capable of producing up to 4053 kW at 80% power factor, or 5066.25 kVA. </p>
      <p>Generators 1 and 2 are located in engineroom 1 and directly feed main switchboard No.1, and generators 3 and 4 are located in engine room 2 and feed main switchboard No. 2.  The switchboards can be split or cross-connected as necessary for emergency operations.</p>

      <p>Each switchboard supplies electrical power at 60 Hz, 1850 Volts to a <term>Propulsion Converter</term> via a step-down <term>transformer</term>. The purpose of the propulsion converters is to change input voltage and frequency to the voltage and frequency needed to spin the propulsion motor in the desired direction, at the desired speed, as ordered by the bridge. </p>
      <p>Each propulsion converter provides power to a <term>Propulsion Motor</term>.  The two propulsion motors drive a common shaft which is directly connected to the ship’s single propeller, as shown in <xref ref="DriveTrain"/>.  </p>

         <p>Four 4000 kW, 6600 volt, three-phase generators provide electrical power for propulsion and for all other normal ship’s requirements.

         <title>Description</title>
         <p>As discussed in <xref ref="AC_generators"/>, the essential components of an AC generator are the armature and the field, one of which is located on the rotor and the other on the stator.  However a practical generator requires many other components, including an enclosure, bearings, cooling, lubrication, instrumentation and control, and a method to excite the field.  </p>
         <p>These components are shown in <xref ref="generator"/> and  <xref ref="generator_exploded"/> and discussed below.</p>
         <p>The shaft is supported by two journal bearings (7 and 13), one on the drive end (<term>DE</term>) and the other on the non-drive end (<term>NDE</term>).  Each bearing has its own integral oil sump with sight glass, cooling fins, and an oil ring that circulates the oil to the top of the shaft as it rotates. </p>
         <p>The shaft itself supports and carries the rotating components: primarily the main rotor core (9) and the 8-pole main field windings (4), but also a cooling fan (2) and several other components (10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 19) that are required to excite the generator.  Excitation systems will be discussed in <xref ref="Electric-propulsion-excitation-system"/>. </p>
         <p>The main field (4) on the rotor is wound to create eight alternating north and south poles. The main stator core (8) surrounds the main rotor (9) and is wound with three main armature windings (3).  As the shaft rotates, the rotor’s magnetic field sweeps by the each of the three armature windings in turn, and induces a sinusoidal voltage in each as shown in <xref ref="three-phase"/>.  The resulting 3-phase AC is directed to the generator terminals (23), and from there connections are made to the main switchboard.</p>

         <p>Both the main core and the stator core are made of thin sheets of <term>electrical steel</term>, called <term>laminations</term>, clamped tightly together. The stationary armature windings (3) and the rotating field windings (4) are inserted into slots formed when the laminations were pressed out, and are firmly wedged in to hold them in position. </p>
         <p>Electrical steel is a speciality steel used in the cores of electrical machines such as motors, generators, and transformers. It is an iron alloy with silicon (instead of carbon) as the main additive element. Silicon increases the electrical resistivity of iron by a factor of about 5.  Electrical steel also has favorable magnetic properties which tend to reduce magnetic <term>hysteresis</term>
            <mdash/> an energy loss caused by the repeated magnetization and de magnetization of the core.  These properties reduce energy losses in the core by about three times compared to conventional steel,</p>
         <p>The laminations are insulated from each other to prevent current from flowing axially along the core.  These currents, called <term>eddy currents</term>, are another source of energy loss, so using insulated laminations improves the generator efficiency.  </p>
         <p>Generators produce lots of heat while they are operating due to unavoidable losses caused by mechanical friction and electrical resistance, and other factors.  If this heat is not removed as it is produced, the generator temperature will rise to unacceptable limits, and high temperature is extremely damaging to electrical insulation. Electrical machines are designed to run for 100,000 hours or more when operated at or below their design temperature limit, however for every 10° C rise above this temperature, the thermal life expectancy of the electrical insulation is reduced by half, so generator cooling is critical.</p>
         <p>The generator’s cooling system uses the shaft driven internal fan (2) to circulate the air through the machine. This hot air passes over a water-cooled heat exchanger where it is cooled and then recirculated.  The cooling water tubes are double walled with slotted plate fins. Water flows through the inner tube and cools the outer tube and the slotted fins. Air flows between the fins and around the outer tubes and so is cooled.  </p>
         <p>In the case of a tube leak,  water will flow between the inner and outer tubes to a leak detector and trigger an alarm.  This prevents water from leaking on to the electrical components.</p>
         <p>If for some reason the cooling water is not available, an  emergency cooling mode is available.  In this mode  cover plates on the generator are removed to allow the fan to draw cool air from the engine room and discharge the heated air outside the generator. </p>

         <title>Excitation System</title>
         <introduction>
            <p>The purpose of the excitation system is to <term>excite</term> the generator’s field.  That is, the system supplies the DC voltage and current to the generator’s main field windings that creates the magnetic field required for electrical generation.  The amount of excitation current determines the strength of this field, which in turn affects the generator output.</p>
            <p>Generator excitation systems consists of several components that work together excite the field, maintain a constant and correct output voltage despite fluctuations in the load or other system conditions, and balance the reactive power when the generator is operating in parallel.</p>
            <p>There are several different excitation system designs in use, each with particular advantages and disadvantages. These can be broadly categorized as separately or self excited, and brushed or brushless excitation systems.</p>
            <p>In a <term>separately excited</term> excitation system, the excitation current is provided by an external DC power source. The generator's field winding is connected to a separate power supply, which is independent of the generator's output.  Separately excited generators tend to be more stable and less sensitive to load fluctuations because the excitation current is not affected by the generator's output. They provide better voltage regulation and are commonly used in applications that require precise control.</p>
            <p>A <term>self-excited</term> system, on the other hand, uses the generator’s own output voltage to produce the excitation current. The generator's output voltage is connected, in parallel, to both the field circuit and to the load. In this design, generator excitation is effectively an additional load on the generator.  Self-excited generators are simpler and less expensive, but are inherently less stable and more sensitive to load changes due to the coupling between the generator load, output voltage, and excitation current. Voltage regulation is more difficult, especially under sudden changes in load.</p>
            <p>
               <term>Brushed</term> exciters use carbon brushes and copper slip rings to transmit the excitation current to the rotating generator rotor winding. Brushed exciters are simple and inexpensive and they were once widely used; however, they require significant maintenance including cleaning, adjustment, and periodic replacement of worn brushes.  They are being superseded by brushless exciters in new generators.</p>
            <p>
               <term>Brushless</term> exciters use solid-state devices, such as diodes, thyristors, and transistors mounted on the rotating shaft, to rectify the output voltage of the exciter generator.  They eliminate the need for brushes and slip rings, so are more reliable, require less maintenance, and offer better voltage control than brushed exciters.</p>

            <title>Exciter</title>
            <p>An <term>exciter</term>, also known as an <term>excitation generator</term>, is a second generator which spins on the same shaft as the main generator.  The function of the exciter is to produce the direct current required to energize the main rotor windings, thereby creating a magnetic field. </p>
            <p>There are several important differences between the main generator and the exciter.  Although both are 3-phase generators, the main generator has a rotating field and a stationary armature while the exciter has a stationary field and a rotating armature.   The exciter is much smaller than the main generator; the main generator can generate more than 440 A, while the exciter generates less than 4 A.</p>

            <p>Just as the exciter generator is needed to supply the field for the main generator, a third generator is needed to supply the field for the exciter.  This is the <term>pilot generator</term>. </p>
            <p>In other words, the main generator is excited by the exciter, and the exciter is excited by the pilot generator. This process stops here however, because the field of the pilot generator is produced by permanent magnets, not a field winding.

The rotor carries sixteen permanent magnets of alternating polarities bolted to the rotating shaft.  The stator is bolted onto the bearing housing and carries 3-phase wye-connected armature windings.  The rotating magnets induce a three-phase AC voltage into the stator windings.</p>

            <p>Because the source of the excitation in this generator is from permanent magnets, rather than an electromagnet excited by the output of the main generator, the generator is considered separately excited.  The main advantage of separate excitation is that fluctuations in the voltage of the main generator do not affect the excitation supply. Voltage fluctuations can be quickly corrected and the generator output can be maintained within tight tolerances..</p>

            <p>The three main components of the AVR are the Digital Signal Processor, the Rectifier, and the Power Module. The device uses a combination of hardware and software to perform its functions.</p>
            <p>The <term>Digital Signal Processor</term>
               <term>(DSP)</term> is a specialized microprocessor designed to process and manipulate digital signals in real time.  The DSP software is executable code stored in nonvolatile Flash memory.  The DSP executes code and controls hardware to enable the AVR to perform functions such as regulation, measurement, monitoring, protection, and communications.</p>
            <p>The DSP accepts both digital and analog inputs, the most important being the generator voltage and current, which are measured using current and potential (voltage) transformers on the generator output, and digitized by an <term>analog to digital converter</term> (<term>ADC</term>) in the DSP.  Based on these values and the system requirements, the DSP calculates the amount of excitation current required and produces a command signal that is transmitted to the Power Module.</p>
            <p>The <term>Rectifier</term> module supplies DC power to the power module.  The power source for the module may come from a Permanent Magnet Generator, as done on the training ship, or directly from the main generator terminals if the generator is self-excited.  The module uses a three-phase full-wave rectifier, <xref ref="three_phase_rectifier"/>, to convert the supply to a DC voltage. </p>
            <p>The Power Module uses <term>pulse width modulation</term>
               <term>(PWM)</term> to trigger a set of <term>insulated gate bipolar transistors</term> (<term>IGBT)</term> that supply the requested excitation current  An excitation current signal is transmitted back to the DSP to be used for to PID feedback, and for over-excitation limitation, protection functions and monitoring.  PWM and IGBTs are discussed in more detail in <xref ref="what-is-pulse-width-modulation" text="title"/> and <xref ref="what-is-an-igbt" text="title"/>.</p>

         <p>The propeller shaft is supported by journal bearings which maintain radial alignment, and a thrust bearing which transmits thrust from the propeller to the hull and  maintains axial alignment. The shaft is equipped with turning gear and a shaft lock. When either of these is engaged, propulsion is blocked. </p>

         <title>Description</title>
         <p>The stator core is made up of electrically insulated sheets, braced with clamping bolts and rings and mounted in the stator housing. The stator windings consists of layered coils mounted in the open slots of the stator core. The stator has two terminal boxes on the stator housing for electrical connections. </p>
         <p>The rotor is comprised of a forged shaft with a shrunk on rotor body. The rotor windings are formed by bars and rings embedded together and brazed by an induction heating method to form a squirrel cage. </p>
         <p>The rotor is supported with self-lubricated, bushed bearings. There are two jacking oil pumps for the drive end bearings and two jacking oil pumps for the non-drive end bearings, normally with one operating and one in standby. </p>
         <p>The motors are fitted with two air-water heat exchangers providing cooled air which is forced through internal cooling openings via four 440V 9.2 kW electric-motor driven fans. This air is then circulated back to the coolers. In the event of fan failure, it is still possible to operate at a reduced speed.  In the event of cooling water failure, the motor is provided with emergency air openings in the cooler hood and in the stator housing which can be removed for natural cooling. </p>

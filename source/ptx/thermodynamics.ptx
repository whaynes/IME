   <introduction>
      <p>
         <em>Adapted from Principles of Naval Engineering</em> The process of generating steam is basically simple. You boil water and continue to add heat until the water turns into steam. But how can this steam cause a ship to move through the water? How can steam provide power for steering, ventilation, refrigeration, distillation of seawater, and all the other needs of the vessel? </p>
      <p>Steam does not do any of these things directly. But some of the thermal energy contained in the steam can be converted into other forms of energy to move the ship through the water and to provide power for vital shipboard services. </p>
      <p>In this chapter we will discuss some basic ideas of energy and some of the important energy transformations that occur in the engineering plant of a steam-driven ship. Study this chapter carefully. The information given here will not help you to light off a boiler, clean firesides, stand a watch, or wipe up oil from the floorplates; however, it will help you to understand the generation of steam, the use of steam in the shipboard engineering plant, and the relationship of the boilers to the rest of the engineering plant. Understanding the information given in this chapter will also give you a sound background for understanding some of the more complicated things that you will have to learn as you advance. </p>
      <p>As you study this chapter, watch out for unfamiliar definitions. Many of the words and terms used will be familiar to you, but the definitions we use may be more precise than the ones you have heard before. Be sure that you understand the exact meaning of each word and term used in connection with energy and energy transformations. </p>

      <title>Energy</title>
      <introduction>
         <p>Can you define energy? Although everyone has a general idea of the meaning of energy, a good definition is hard to find. Most commonly, perhaps, energy is defined as the <q>ability of a system to do work.</q> This is not a very complete definition. Energy can produce other effects which cannot possibly be considered <q>work.</q> For example, heat can flow from one object to another without doing work; yet heat is a form of energy, and the process of heat transfer is a process that produces an effect. </p>
         <p>A better definition of energy, therefore, states that <q>energy is the capacity for producing an effect.</q> Energy exists in many forms. For convenience, we usually classify energy according to the size and nature of the bodies or particles with which it is associated. Thus we say that <em>Mechanical energy</em> is the energy associated with large bodies or objects, usually, things that are big enough to see. <em>Thermal energy</em> is energy associated with molecules. <em>Chemical energy</em> is energy that arises from the forces which bind the atoms together in a molecule, Chemical energy is demonstrated whenever combustion or any other chemical reaction takes place. <em>Electro-magnetic</em> energy is energy that is associated with the electron and charged particles. Light, x-rays and radio waves are examples of electro-magnetic energy. <em>Nuclear energy</em> is associated with the particles in the nucleus, and is governed by Einstein’s famous equation <m>E = mc^2</m> Each of these types of energy (mechanical energy, thermal energy, etc.) must also be classified as being either stored energy, or energy in transition.  <em>Stored energy</em> can be thought of as energy that is actually <q>contained in</q> or <q>stored in</q> a substance or system. There are two kinds of stored energy: potential energy, and kinetic energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the relative <em>positions</em> of two or more objects or particles, we call it potential energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the relative <em>velocities</em> of two or more objects or particles, we call it kinetic energy.  </p>

         <p>If you do not completely understand this classification, come back to it from time to time as you read the following sections on mechanical energy and thermal energy. The examples and discussion given in the following sections will probably help you to understand this classification. </p>

      <subsection xml:id="mechanicalenergy">
         <title>Mechanical Energy</title>
         <introduction>
            <p>Let’s consider first the two stored forms of mechanical energy. </p>
            <p>Mechanical <em>potential</em> energy exists because of the relative positions of two or more objects. For example, a rock resting on the edge of a cliff in such a position that it will fall freely if pushed has mechanical potential energy. Water at the top of a dam has mechanical potential energy. A sled that is being held at the top of an icy hill has mechanical potential energy. </p>
            <p>Mechanical <em>kinetic</em> energy exists because of the relative velocities of two or more objects. If you push that rock, open the gate of the dam, or let go of the sled, something will move. The rock will fall; the water will flow; the sled will slide down the hill. In each case the mechanical potential energy will be changed to mechanical kinetic energy. Another way of saying this is <q>energy of position will be changed to energy of motion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In these examples, you will notice that an external source of energy is used to get things started. Energy from some outside source is required to push the rock, open the gate of the dam, or let go of the sled. All real machines and processes require this kind of <q>boost</q> from an energy source outside the system. For example, there is a tremendous amount of chemical energy stored in fuel oil; but this energy will not raise steam in the boiler until you have expended some energy to start the oil burning. Similarly, the energy in any one system affects other energy systems. However, it is easier to learn the basic principles of energy if we forget about all the energy systems that might be involved in or affected by each energy process. In the examples given in this chapter, therefore, we will consider only one energy process or energy system at a time, disregarding both the energy <q>boosts</q> that may be received from outside systems and the energy transfers that may take place between the system we are considering and other systems. </p>
            <p>Notice that both mechanical potential energy and mechanical kinetic energy are stored forms of energy. It is easy to see why we regard mechanical potential energy as being stored, but it is not so easy to see the same thing about mechanical kinetic energy. Part of the trouble comes about because mechanical kinetic energy is often referred to as <q>the energy of motion,</q> thus leading to the false conclusion that <q>energy in transition</q> is somehow involved. This is not the case, however. Work is the only form of mechanical energy that can be properly considered as energy in transition. </p>
            <p>If you have trouble with the idea that mechanical kinetic energy is stored, rather than in transition, think of it like this. A bullet that has been fired from a gun has mechanical kinetic energy because it is in motion. The faster the bullet is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. There is no doubt in anybody’s mind that the bullet has the capacity to produce an effect, so we may safely say that it has energy. Although the bullet is in transition, the energy of the bullet is not transferred to any other object or system until the bullet strikes some object which resists its passage. When the bullet strikes against a resisting object, then, and only then, can we say that energy in transition exists, in the form of heat and work. </p>
            <p>In this example, we are ignoring the fact that some work is done against the resistance of the air and that some heat results from the passage of the bullet through the air. But this does not change the basic idea that kinetic energy is stored energy rather than energy in transition. The air must merely be regarded as a <q>resisting object</q> which causes some of the stored kinetic energy of the bullet to be converted into energy in transition (heat and work) while the bullet is passing through the air. However, the major part of the stored kinetic energy does not become energy in transition until the bullet strikes an object firmer than air which resists its passage. </p>
            <p>In the English system of units, mechanical potential energy is measured in foot-pounds. Consider, for example, the rock at the top of the cliff. If the rock weighs 5 pounds and if the distance from the rock to the earth at the base of the cliff is 100 feet, 500 foot-pounds of mechanical potential energy exist because of the relative positions of the rock and the earth. Another way of expressing this idea is by the formula:  </p>
            <p>
               <me>PE = mgh</me>
            </p>
            <p>
              Where:
              <ul marker="">
                  <li>
                     <m>PE</m> = potential energy (in foot-pounds) </li>
                  <li>
                     <m>mg</m> = total weight of the object (in pounds) </li>
                  <li>
                     <m>h</m> = distance between the earth and the object (in feet) </li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Mechanical kinetic energy is also measured in foot-pounds. The amount of kinetic energy present at any one time is directly related to the velocity of the moving object and to the weight of the moving object. <me>KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2</me>
            </p>
            <p>
              Where:
              <ul marker="">
                  <li>
                     <m>KE</m> = Kinetic energy </li>
                  <li>
                     <m>m</m> = Mass of object </li>
                  <li>
                     <m>v</m> = Velocity of object relative to earth </li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Mechanical potential energy can be changed into mechanical kinetic energy. If you push that 5-pound rock over the edge of the 100-foot cliff, it begins to fall, and, as it falls, it loses potential energy and gains kinetic energy. At any given moment, the total amount of mechanical energy (potential plus kinetic) stored in the system is the same - that is, 500 foot-pounds. But the proportions of potential energy and kinetic energy are changing all the time as the rock is falling. Just before the rock hits the earth, all the stored mechanical energy is kinetic energy. As the rock hits the earth, the kinetic energy is changed into energy in transition-that is, work and heat. </p>
            <p>Mechanical kinetic energy can likewise be changed into mechanical potential energy. For example, suppose you throw a baseball straight up in the air. The ball has kinetic energy while it is motion, but the amount of kinetic energy decreases and the amount of potential energy increases as the ball travels upward. When the ball has reached its uppermost position, just before it starts to fall back to earth, it has only potential energy. Then, as it falls back toward the earth, the potential energy is changed into kinetic energy again. </p>
         </introduction>
         <subsubsection xml:id="work">
            <title>Work</title>
            <p>Mechanical energy in transition is called <em>work.</em> When an object is moved through a distance against a resisting force, we say that work has been done. The formula for calculating work is:  <me>W=Fd</me>
            </p>
            <p>
              Where:
              <ul marker="">
                  <li>
                     <m>W</m> = work (in foot-pounds)  </li>
                  <li>
                     <m>F</m> = force (in pounds) </li>
                  <li>
                     <m>d</m> = distance moved in direction of applied force (in feet)  </li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>As you can see from this formula, you need to know how much force is exerted and the distance through which the force acts before you can find how much work is done. The unit of force is the pound. When work is done against gravity, the force required to move an object is equal to the weight of the object. Why? Because weight is a measure of the force of gravity or, in other words, a measure of the force of attraction between an object and the earth. How much work will you do if you lift that 5-pound rock from the bottom of the 100-foot cliff to the top? You will do 500 foot-pounds of work-the weight of the object (5 pounds) times the distance (100 feet) that you move it against gravity. </p>
            <p>We also do work against forces other than the force of gravity. When you push an object across the deck, you are doing work against friction. In this case, the force you work against is not only the weight of the object; but also the force required to overcome friction and slide the object over the surface of the deck. </p>
            <p>Notice that mechanical potential energy, mechanical kinetic energy and work are all measured in the same unit, foot-pounds. One foot-pound of work is done when a force of 1 pound acts through a distance of 1 foot. One foot-pound of mechanical potential energy or mechanical kinetic energy is the amount of energy that is required to accomplish 1 foot-pound of work. </p>

      <subsection xml:id="thermalenergy">
         <title>Thermal Energy</title>
         <introduction>
            <p>All substances are composed of molecules. The energy associated with molecules is called thermal energy. Thermal energy, like mechanical energy, exists in two stored forms and in one transitional form. The two stored forms of thermal energy are called internal potential energy, and internal kinetic energy. Thermal energy in transition is called <em>heat.</em>Although molecules are too small to be seen, they behave in some ways pretty much like the larger objects we considered in the discussion of mechanical energy. Molecules have energy of position (internal potential energy) because of the forces which attract molecules to each other. In this way, they are somewhat like the rock and the earth we considered before. Molecules have energy of motion (internal kinetic energy) because they are constantly in motion. Thus, the two stored forms of thermal energy-internal potential energy and internal kinetic energy-are in some ways similar to mechanical potential energy and mechanical kinetic energy, except that everything is on a smaller scale. </p>
         </introduction>
         <subsubsection xml:id="temp">
            <title>Temperature</title>
            <p>You are probably already familiar with temperature, and know that we use is it to describe how hot or cold an object is, but what, exactly is it? Temperature is not energy and it’s not heat. It is simply a number related to the average kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance; the greater the average kinetic energy, the greater the temperature. Notice that temperature is not equal to the kinetic energy, just proportional to it, and temperature readings do not tell you anything directly about the potential energy of the substance. </p>
            <p>Temperature can be measured in a variety of scales. When the temperature scale is measured up from the point where there is no molecular motion, it is known as an absolute scale, and is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the substance. The Kelvin and Rankine scales are absolute scales. We normally use the Fahrenheit or Celsius scales, which are offset from the corresponding absolute scale, and so are only indirectly related to the kinetic energy. </p>
         </subsubsection>
         <subsubsection xml:id="internalenergy">
            <title>Internal Energy</title>
            <p>Although the term may be unfamiliar to you, you probably know more about <em>internal energy</em> than you realize. Because molecules are constantly in motion, they exert a pressure on the walls of the pipe, boiler, cylinder, or other object in which they are contained. Also, the temperature of any substance arises from, and is directly proportional to, the activity of the molecules. Therefore, every time you read thermometers and pressure gages you are finding out something about the amount of internal energy contained in the substance. High pressures and temperatures indicate that the molecules are moving rapidly and that the substance therefore has a lot of internal energy. </p>
            <p>For most purposes, we will not need to distinguish between the two stored forms of thermal energy. Therefore, instead of referring to internal potential energy and internal kinetic energy, from now on we will simply use the term <q>internal energy.</q> By internal energy, then, we will mean the sum total of all internal energy stored in the substance or system because of the motion of the molecules and because of the forces of attraction between molecules. </p>
         </subsubsection>
         <subsubsection xml:id="heat">
            <title>Heat</title>
            <p>
               <em>Heat</em> is a more familiar term than internal energy, but may actually be more difficult to define correctly. The important thing to remember is that heat is <em>thermal energy in transition</em> - that is, it is thermal energy that is moving from one substance or system to another. </p>
            <p>An example will help to illustrate the difference between heat and internal energy. Suppose there are two equal lengths of pipe made of identical materials and containing steam at the same pressure and temperature. One pipe is well insulated; the other is not insulated at all. From everyday experience you know that more heat will flow from the uninsulated pipe than from the insulated pipe. When the two pipes are first filled with steam, the steam in one pipe contains exactly as much internal energy as the steam in the other pipe. We know this is true because the two pipes contain equal volumes of steam at the same pressure and at the same temperature. After a few minutes, the steam in the uninsulated pipe will contain much less internal energy than the steam in the insulated pipe, as we can tell by measuring the pressure and the temperature of the steam in each pipe. What has happened? Stored thermal energy - internal energy - has moved from one system to another, first from the steam to the pipe, then from the uninsulated pipe to the air. This movement or flow of thermal energy from one system to another is called heat. </p>
            <p>A good deal of confusion exists concerning the use of the word <q>heat.</q> For example, you will hear people say that a hot object <q>contains</q> a lot of heat when they really mean that it contains a lot of internal energy. Or you will hear that heat is <q>added to</q> or <q>removed from</q> a substance. Since heat is the flow of thermal energy, it can no more be added to a substance than the flow of water could be added to a river. (You might add water, and this addition might increase the flow; but you could hardly say that you had added flow.) The only kind of thermal energy that can in any sense be added to or removed from a substance is internal energy. The distinction between heat and internal energy must be clear in your own mind before you can understand the basic principles of a steam plant. Remember, steam contains internal energy but it does not <q>contain heat.</q> Heat exists when the internal energy flows from the steam to something else (another substance or system). </p>
         </subsubsection>
         <subsubsection xml:id="enthalpy">
            <title>Enthalpy</title>
            <p>When discussing a system involving work and heat, such as a boiler and turbine, you may hear the term <em>enthalpy.</em> Enthalpy is a thermodynamic quantity defined as the sum of internal energy and the work done by the substance to move its surroundings out of the way as it moves or expands, known as <q>flow work.</q> One consequence of this definition is that when heat flows into a substance at constant pressure, its enthalpy increases by the amount of heat energy added. This is why enthalpy is sometimes described as the <q>heat content</q> of a substance. Remember that heat is energy in transition, and is never stored so no substance ever really <q>contains</q> heat. </p>
         </subsubsection>
         <subsubsection xml:id="unitsofmeasurement">
            <title>Units of Measurement</title>
            <p>In engineering, temperature is commonly measured in degrees Fahrenheit. In this scale, the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure is designated 212°, and the freezing point is 32° with 180 equal degrees between. When working in the metric system, the Celsius scale is used. The Celsius scale (sometimes called the centigrade scale) uses zero as the freezing point of water and 100° as its boiling point, with 100 equal divisions or degrees between. </p>
            <p>To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit: multiply by 1.8 and add 32.  <me>°\mathrm{F} = (1.8 \times °\mathrm{C}) + 32°</me>The British thermal unit (BTU) is used to measure heat. Originally, 1 BTU was defined as the quantity of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water through 1° on the Fahrenheit (F) scale. A similar unit called the calorie (cal) was originally defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water through 1° on the Celsius (C) scale. The BTU and calorie are still in use, but the original definitions have been abandoned by international agreement. These units are now defined in terms of the unit of energy called the <q>joule.</q> By definition, 1 BTU is equal to 1054.886 joules, and 1 cal is equal to 4.18605 joules. As may be seen, the BTU is a much larger unit than the calorie; 1 BTU is equal to approximately 252 cal. </p>

            <title>Heat Transfer</title>
            <p>Heat can flow from one substance to another only when a temperature difference exists. Heat flow can occur only from a higher temperature to a lower temperature. When two objects at different temperatures are placed in contact with each other (or near each other), heat flows from the warmer object to the cooler one until both are at the same temperature. Heat transfer occurs at a faster rate when there is a larger temperature difference between the two objects. As the temperature difference approaches zero, the rate of heat transfer approaches zero. </p>
            <p>Conduction, radiation, and convection are usually considered to be the three methods by which heat transfer can occur. It is more accurate, however, to consider conduction and radiation as the two basic methods of heat transfer and to consider convection separately as a special process which involves movement within a mass of fluid. </p>
            <paragraphs>
               <title>Conduction</title>
               <p>Conduction is the method by which heat flows from a hotter to a colder substance when there is physical contact between the two substances. For example, consider a cold metal bar which is held firmly against a piece of red-hot metal. In a short time, the end of the bar which is not touching the hotter metal will have become too hot to hold. We say that heat has been conducted from molecule to molecule, throughout the entire bar. The process of conduction will continue as long as there is a temperature difference between the two ends of the bar. </p>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
               <title>Radiation</title>
               <p>Radiation is a mode of heat transfer that does not require any physical contact between the warmer substance and the cooler substance. For example, a person sitting near a hot stove is warmed by radiant heat even though the air between the person and the stove may remain cold. Similarly, radiant heat from the sun warms the earth without warming the space through which it passes. </p>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
               <title>Convection</title>
               <p>At the molecular or sub-molecular level, heat transfer takes place through both the processes of conduction and radiation. If we use the term <q>heat transfer</q> in a somewhat different way, we may also include convection as a mode of heat transfer. However, it is important to understand the difference between convection and the basic heat transfer processes of conduction and radiation. </p>
               <p>If we put a hot brick into a wheelbarrow and wheel it across the street, we have in one sense <q>transferred</q> heat. However, any heat transfer that takes place between the brick and its surroundings while we are wheeling it across the street will be by conduction and by radiation. Therefore, it would really be more accurate to say that we have <q>transported</q> the brick and all its contained thermal energy from one side of the street to the other. </p>
               <p>Convection occurs only in fluids – liquids, gases, and vapors – not in solids, such as the brick we have just transported in the wheelbarrow. Convection is the transportation or movement of some portions of a fluid within the total mass of the fluid. As this movement occurs, the moving portions of the fluid transfer their contained thermal energy from one part of the fluid to another. The effect of convection is thus to mix the various portions of the fluid; the part that was at the bottom of the container may move to the top, or the part that was at one side may move to the other side. As this mixing takes place, heat transfer occurs from one part of the fluid to another and between the fluid and its surroundings. But this heat transfer, like any other heat transfer, takes place by conduction and by radiation. In other words, convection transports portions of the fluid; conduction and radiation transfer the thermal energy. </p>
               <p>Convection serves a vital purpose in bringing the different parts of the fluid into close contact so that heat transfer can occur. Without convection, there can be little heat transfer from or within fluids. Most fluids are poor conductors of heat when they are not in motion. </p>
               <p>What causes this transportation of a mass of fluid? In the case of <em>natural convection</em>, the movement is caused by differences in the density of different parts of the fluid. The differences in density are usually caused by unequal temperatures within the mass of fluid. For example, as the air over a hot radiator is heated, it becomes less dense and therefore begins to rise. Cooler, heavier air is drawn in to replace the heated air, and convection currents are thus setup. Another example of natural convection is the circulation of water in a natural circulation boiler. As the water in the generating tubes is heated, it expands and becomes much lighter (less dense) than the cooler water in the downcomers. Therefore the hotter and lighter water rises, while the cooler and heavier water flows downward. The resulting circulation of water in the boiler is thus clearly an example of convection currents established by differences in temperature (and therefore differences in density) in various parts of the fluid. </p>
               <p>In the case of <em>forced convection</em>, some mechanical device such as a pump or a fan produces the movement of the fluid. When the main feed pump moves feedwater toward the boiler, the water is transported by forced convection. The flow of combustion gases through a boiler is partly by natural convection and partly by forced convection. Natural convection occurs because the gases of combustion are hotter and lighter than air, so they tend to rise and go up the stack. Forced convection is also involved in this process, however, because the forced draft blowers supply an air pressure which increases the rate at which the combustion gases travel across the tubes and up the stack. When you stir a cup of hot coffee, you are forcing convection and thus increasing the rate of heat transfer. Natural convection currents would be set up in the coffee if you did not stir it, because differences in density would occur as some portions of the coffee cooled before others. If you want to cool the coffee rapidly, use forced convection (stirring). If you do not want it to cool so rapidly, wait for natural convection to do the job. </p>
               <p>In summary, then, we use the term convection to describe the transportation, or loosely, the <q>heat transfer</q> of a mass of fluid and its contained thermal energy. However, the processes by which any substance gains or loses thermal energy are most accurately described in terms of conduction and radiation. </p>

         <subsubsection xml:id="sensibleheatandlatentheat">
            <title>Sensible Heat and Latent Heat</title>
            <p>The terms <em>sensible heat</em> and <em>latent heat</em> are often used to indicate the effect that the flow of heat has on a substance. The flow of heat from one substance to another is normally reflected in a temperature change in each substance-the hotter substance becomes cooler; the cooler substance becomes hotter. However, the flow of heat is not reflected in a temperature change in a substance that is in the process of changing from one physical state (solid, liquid, or gas) to another. When the flow of heat is reflected in a temperature change, we say that sensible heat has been added to or removed from the substance. When the flow of heat is not reflected in a temperature change but is reflected in the changing physical state of a substance, we say that latent heat has been added or removed. </p>
            <p>Does anything bother you in this last paragraph? It should. Here we are, talking about adding and removing heat. And, furthermore, we are talking about sensible heat and latent heat as though we had two different kinds of heat to consider. As noted before, this is common (if inaccurate) engineering language. So keep the following points clear in your mind: (1) heat is the flow of thermal energy; (2) when we talk about adding and removing heat, we mean that we are providing temperature differentials so that thermal energy can flow from one substance to another; and (3) when we talk about sensible heat and latent heat, we are talking about two different kinds of effects that can be produced by heat, but not about two different kinds of heat. </p>
            <p>The three basic physical states of all matter are <em>solid,</em>
               <em>liquid,</em> and <em>gas</em> (or vapor). The physical state of a substance is closely related to the distance between molecules. The molecules are closest together in solids, farther apart in liquids, and farthest apart in gases. When the flow of heat to a substance is not reflected in a temperature change, we know that the energy is being used to increase the distance between the molecules of the substance and thus to change it from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. Such a change is known as a <em>phase change</em>. You might say that latent heat is the energy price that must be paid for a change of state from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. The energy is not lost; rather, it is stored in the substance as internal energy. The energy price is <q>repaid,</q> so to speak, when the substance changes back from gas to liquid or from liquid to solid. </p>

            <p>
               <xref ref="LatentHeat_png"/> shows the relationship between sensible heat and latent heat for one substance, water, at atmospheric pressure. The same kind of chart could be drawn up for other substances; however, different amounts of thermal energy would of course be required for each change of temperature and for each change of physical state. </p>
            <p>If we start with 1 pound of ice at 0 °F, we must add 16 BTU in order to raise the temperature of the ice to 32 °F. We call this adding sensible heat. To change the pound of ice at 32 °F to a pound of water at 32 °F, we must add 144 BTU (the <em>latent heat of fusion</em>). There will be no change in temperature while the ice is melting. After all the ice has melted, however, the temperature of the water will be raised as additional heat is supplied. If we add 180 BTU that is, 1 BTU for each degree of temperature between 32 °F and 212 °F the temperature of the water will be raised to the boiling point. To change the pound of water at 212 °F, to a pound of steam at 212 °F, we must add 970 BTU (the <em>latent heat of vaporization</em>). After all the water has been converted to steam, the addition of more heat will cause an increase in the temperature of the steam. If we add approximately 42 BTU to the pound of steam which is at 212 °F, we can superheat it to 300 °F. </p>
            <p>The same relationships apply when heat is being removed. The removal of 42 BTU from the pound of steam which is at 300 °F will cause the temperature to drop to 212 °F. As the pound of steam at 212 °F changes to a pound of water at 212 °F, 970 BTU are given off. When a substance is changing from a gas or vapor to a liquid, we usually use the term <em>latent heat of condensation</em> for the heat that is given off. Notice, however, that the latent heat of condensation is exactly the same as the latent heat of vaporization. Only the terms differ to indicate whether a substance is being changed into a liquid or into a gas. The removal of another 180 BTU of sensible heat will lower the temperature of the pound of water from 212 °F to 32 °F. As the pound of water at 32 °F changes to a pound of ice at 32 °F 144 BTU are given off without any accompanying change of temperature. Further removal of heat causes the temperature of the ice to decrease. </p>

         <subsubsection xml:id="specificheat">
            <title>Specific Heat</title>
            <p>In the discussion of sensible heat and latent heat, you may have noticed that it takes only 16 BTU to raise the temperature of 1 pound of ice from 0 °F to 32 °F that is, only 1/2 BTU for each degree of rise in temperature. However, we know that it takes 1 BTU (on the average) to raise the temperature of the same amount of water 1 °F. This difference occurs because the <em>specific heat</em> of water is about twice the specific heat of ice. </p>
            <p>Specific heat is a thermal property of matter that must be determined experimentally for each substance. In general, we may say that specific heat is the property of matter; this explains the reason that equal quantities of thermal energy added to two different substances will not necessarily produce the same temperature rise, even when no change of state is involved. The specific heat of a substance is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of the substance 1 °F. For most engineering applications, specific heat is expressed in BTU per pound per degree Fahrenheit. In metric systems of measurement, specific heat is expressed in calories per gram per degree Celsius. Even though the units of measurement are different in the different systems, the <em>numerical value</em> of specific heat for any given substance is the same in all systems. The specific heat of water is 1.00 in all systems. </p>

      <title>Power</title>
      <p>
         <em>Power</em> is the rate of doing work. The amount of work done has nothing at all to do with how long it takes to do it. When you lift a weight of 1 pound through a distance of 1 foot, you have done 1 foot-pound of work, regardless of whether you do it in half a second or half an hour. A device which can do a lot of work quickly is powerful. The common unit of measurement for power is the <em>horsepower</em> (hp). By definition, 1 horsepower is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute or 550 foot-pounds of work per second. Thus a machine that is capable of doing 550 foot-pounds of work per second is said to be a 1-horsepower machine. (As you can see, your horsepower rating would not be very impressive if you did 1 foot-pound of work in half an hour. Figure it out. It works out to be just a little more than one-millionth of a horsepower.) </p>

      <title>Energy Transformations</title>
      <introduction>
         <p>The machinery and equipment in the engineering plant aboard ship is designed either to carry energy from one place to another or to change a substance from one form to another. The principles of energy transformations and some of the important energy changes that occur in the shipboard propulsion cycle are discussed here. </p>
      </introduction>
      <subsection xml:id="conservationofenergy">
         <title>Conservation of Energy</title>
         <p>The basic principle dealing with the transformation of energy is the <em>Principle of Conservation of Energy</em>. This principle can be stated in several ways. Most commonly, perhaps, it is stated: <q>Energy can be neither destroyed nor created, but only transformed.</q> Another way to state this principle is: <q>The total quantity of energy in the universe is always the same.</q> Still another way of expressing this principle is by the equation  <me>\mathrm{Energy}_{in} = \mathrm{Energy}_{out}</me>The <q>energy out</q> may be quite different in form from the <q>energy in,</q> but the total amount of energy input must always equal the total amount of energy output. </p>
         <p>Another principle, the <em>Principle of Conservation of Matter,</em> states: <q>Matter can be neither created nor destroyed, but only transformed.</q> As you probably know, the development of the atomic bomb demonstrated that matter can be converted into energy; other developments have demonstrated that energy can be converted into matter. Therefore, the Principle of the Conservation of Energy and the Principle of the Conservation of Matter are no longer considered as two parts of a single law or principle but are combined into one principle: “Matter and energy are interchangeable, and the total amount of energy and matter in the universe is constant." </p>
         <p>The interchangeability of matter and energy is mentioned here only to point out that the statement <q>energy in must equal energy out</q> is not strictly true for certain situations. However, any noticeable conversion of matter into energy or energy into matter can occur only under very special conditions that we need not consider now. All the energy transformations that we will deal with can be understood quite simply if we consider only the Principle of the Conservation of Energy, that is, <em>Energy in must equal Energy out</em>. </p>

         <title>Transforming Heat to Work</title>
         <p>
            The energy transformation of primary interest in the shipboard steam plant is the transformation from heat to work. To see how this transformation occurs, we need to consider the pressure, temperature, and volume relationships which hold true for gases. These relationships may be summarized as follows:
            <ul>
               <li> When the temperature is held constant, increasing the pressure on a gas causes a proportional decrease in volume. Decreasing the pressure causes a proportional increase in volume.  </li>
               <li> When the pressure is held constant, increasing the temperature of a gas causes a proportional increase in volume. Decreasing the temperature causes a proportional decrease in volume.  </li>
               <li> When the volume is held constant, increasing the temperature of a gas causes a proportional increase in pressure. Decreasing the temperature causes a proportional decrease in pressure.  </li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>Suppose we have a boiler in which steam has just begun to form. With the steam stop valves still closed, the volume of the steam remains constant while the temperature and the pressure are both increasing. When operating pressure is reached and the steam stop valves are opened, the high pressure of the steam causes the steam to flow to the turbines. The pressure of the steam thus provides the potential for doing work; the actual conversion of heat to work is done in the steam turbines. The change in the internal energy (as indicated by changes in pressure and temperature) of the steam between the boiler and the condenser is an indication of the amount of heat that has been converted to work in the turbines. </p>
         <p>Since heat is measured in BTU and work is measured in foot-pounds, how can we compare the amount of energy put in as heat with the amount of energy put out as work? At first glance, asking how much heat equals how much work might seem like asking how many lima beans equals playing baseball. However, the problem is not that difficult, since both heat and work are forms of energy. The formula for converting heat to work is  <me>1 \text{ BTU} = 778 \text{ ft-lb}</me> or, in other words, the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water 1 °F is the same as the amount of energy required to lift a 1-pound weight 778 feet against the force of gravity. </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="energyrelationshipsintheshipboardpropulsioncycle">
         <title>Energy Relationships in the Shipboard Propulsion Cycle</title>
         <p>The movement of a ship through the water is the result of a number of energy transformations. Although most of these transformations have been mentioned, they have not been discussed in the proper sequence. </p>
         <p>The first energy transformation occurs when fuel oil is burned in the boiler furnace. By the process of combustion, the chemical energy stored in the fuel oil is transformed into thermal energy. Thermal energy flows from the burning fuel to the water in the boiler, and steam is generated. The thermal energy is now stored as internal energy in the steam, as we can tell from the increased pressure and temperature of the steam. When the steam is admitted to the turbines, the thermal energy of the steam is converted into mechanical energy, which turns the shaft and drives the ship. Two main energy transformations are involved in converting thermal energy to work in a turbine. First, the thermal energy of the steam is transformed into mechanical kinetic energy (energy of motion) as the steam flows through one or more nozzles. Second, the mechanical kinetic energy of the steam is transformed into work (mechanical energy in transition) as the steam strikes the projecting blades of the turbine and thus causes the turbine to turn. The turning of the turbine rotor causes the propeller shaft to turn also, although at a slower speed, since the turbine is connected to the propeller shaft through reduction gears. The steam exhausts from the turbine to the condenser where it gives up its latent heat of condensation to the circulating seawater. </p>
         <p>For the remainder of this cycle, energy is required to get the water (condensate and feedwater) back to the boiler where it will again be heated and changed into steam. The energy used for this purpose is generally the thermal energy of the auxiliary steam. In the case of turbine driven feed pumps, the conversion of thermal energy to mechanical energy occurs in the same way as it does in the case of the propulsion turbines. In the case of motor-driven pumps, the energy conversion is from thermal energy to electrical energy (in a turbogenerator) and then from electrical energy to mechanical energy (work) in the pumps. </p>
         <p>As you can see, putting in 1 BTU at the boiler furnace does not mean that 778 foot-pounds of mechanical energy will be available for propelling the ship through the water. Some of the energy put in at the boiler furnace is used by auxiliary machinery such as pumps and forced-draft blowers to supply the boiler with feedwater, fuel oil, and air for combustion. Distilling plants, turbo-generators, steering gears, heating systems, galley and laundry equipment, and many other units throughout the ship use energy derived directly or indirectly from the energy put in at the boiler furnace. </p>
         <p>In addition, there are many <q>energy losses</q> throughout the engineering plant. As we have seen, energy cannot actually be lost. But when it is transformed into a form of energy that we cannot use, we say there has been an energy loss. Since no insulation is perfect, some thermal energy is always lost as steam travels through the piping. Friction losses occur in all machinery and piping. There is also an energy loss at the condenser as the steam exhausted from the turbines gives up heat to the circulating seawater and turns into condensate. </p>
         <p>Although some energy losses can be partly avoided by designing the machinery and equipment to minimize friction losses, by insulating hot surfaces, and by lubricating moving parts, some energy losses are still unavoidable. Consider, for example, the unavoidable energy loss that occurs at the condenser. To allow the flow of heat, the condenser must be at a lower temperature than the boiler since heat flow can occur only from a higher temperature area to a lower temperature area. Therefore, the energy loss at the condenser is not only unavoidable, but is also actually required for the conversion of heat to work. </p>
         <p>As you can see, each BTU that is put in at the boiler furnace has to be divided in many ways before all the energy can be accounted for, but the energy account will always balance. <em>Energy in will always equal Energy out.</em>

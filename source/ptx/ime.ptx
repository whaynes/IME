      <introduction>
        <p>Measurement is the process of associating numbers with quantities. Units of measurement establish a common language for engineers to communicate and quantify various physical quantities. In the world of engineering, measurement is fundamental. Accurate measurements are crucial for designing, constructing, and evaluating systems. Engineers rely on standardized units and principles of measurement to ensure consistency and precision in their work.</p>
        <p>There are two basic standard units of measurement systems that are used worldwide, the <term>U.S. Standard Measurement System</term> and the <term>Metric System</term> .</p>
        <p>This chapter provides an overview of important qualities and units of measurement used in engineering, covering both the metric and US standard systems as well as nautical measurement. An overview of basic instruments used for making measurements will be discussed along with a discussion and examples of methods of unit conversion.</p>
        <p>As you study this chapter, you will encounter new terms and definitions for you to learn. At the end of the chapter, you will find example problems. Be sure to take the time to practice with these problems. They will help prepare you to apply these concepts.</p>

        <title>Unit Conversions</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>Frequently, engineers need to find equivalents between different systems of measurement. For example, in the construction of a ship there may be different contractors, some of whom use US standard measurement and others who use metric. Since the agreed upon system is metric, conversions are required to standardize all measurements.</p>
          <p>In this section we will demonstrate a flexible and reliable technique for making conversions from one set of units to another called the <term>unit-factor method</term> .</p>
        </introduction>
        <subsection xml:id="unit-factor-method">
          <title>Unit-factor Method</title>
          <p>The <term>unit-factor method</term> or the <term>unity bracket method</term> is a widely used method for unit conversions using the rules of algebra. This method utilizes the fact that any number or expression can be multiplied by one (unity) without changing its value.  The advantage of this method is that it explicitly accounts for units, rather than treating a conversion factor as a <em>magic number</em> .</p>
          <p>To use this method, conversion factors are expressed as fraction equal to <em>one</em> , and multiplied against the original value while keeping careful track of the units in each term. Multiplying a value by a unit-factor and canceling any dimensional units appearing in both the numerator and denominator will express the original quantity in different units.</p>
          <p>For example, since <m>\inch{1} = \cm{2.54}</m> , dividing both sides by <m>\inch{1}</m> inch gives the unit-factor <me>1 = \left[\frac{\cm{2.54}}{\inch{1}}\right]</me> .  The fraction bar in this term can be read as <q>per</q> , so this unit-factor says that there are <q>2.54 centimeters per inch</q> .</p>
          <p>To convert <m>36</m> inches to cm, just multiply by <m>36</m> inches by the appropriate unit-factor, and cancel the inch units that appear in both the numerator and denominator.</p>
          <p><me>\inch{36}  \times \left[\frac{\cm{2.54} }{\inch{1}}\right] =  36 \cancel{\text{ in}} \times \left[\frac{2.54 \text{ cm}}{\cancel{1 \text{ in}}}\right] = \cm{91.44}</me></p>
          <p>To convert from cm to inches, use the reciprocal of this unit-factor, which is also unity.</p>
          <p><me>\cm{100}  \times \left[\frac{\inch{1}}{\cm{2.54} }\right] =  100 \cancel{\text{ cm}} \times \left[\frac{1 \text{ in}}{2.54 \cancel{\text{ cm}}}\right] = \inch{39.37}</me></p>
          <p>Thus <m>\yd{1}</m> ( <m>\inch{36}</m> ) is a bit shorter than a meter ( <m>\cm{100}</m> ), and <m>\m{1}</m> is a little more than <m>\inch{39}.</m></p>
          <p>Unit conversion is often easier <em>within</em> the the SI system, since the relations between units are logical, and the prefixes increase or decrease by <m>10^3</m> , so unit conversions can often be done in your head.</p>
          <p>
            Several different conversion factors can be applied sequentially or simultaneously until only the desired set of dimensional units remains. This way, you only need to remember a few common conversion factors to make many different conversions.  Here are some relations that you should remember:

        <title>Length, Area, and Volume</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>The units of length have changed greatly over time. Long ago, the base of reference was the human body. For example, the cubit was a unit that indicated the length from the elbow to the fingertips.</p>
          <p>Length units based on the human body were used for thousands of years. The Roman mile (In Latin <foreign>mille passus</foreign> , which means <q>thousand paces</q> ) consisted of a thousand paces (of 5 feet each) as measured by every other step—as in the total distance of the left foot hitting the ground 1,000 times, which equals approximately 5,000 ft.</p>
          <figure>
            <caption>Traditional length units</caption>
            <image source="images/cubit.png" width="50%" />
          </figure>
          <p>In 1592, English Parliament wanted to standardize the measurement of the mile and made the decision that it should be equal to eight furlongs. Furlongs, which are still used as a unit of measurement in horse racing, are 660 feet long. Thus, the <term>statute mile</term> we use today is 660 feet times eight = 5,280 ft.</p>
          <figure>

            <image source="images/Imperial_Standards_of_Length,_Greenwich.jpg" width="50%" />
          </figure>
          <p>This continued until a major change took place around 200 years ago. As the Age of Discovery came to an end and industry grew primarily in Western Europe, it became necessary to unify units of length on a global scale. In the 17th century, discussions were held in Europe regarding the unification of units. After a century of discussions, France proposed the unit of the meter (meaning <q>to measure</q> in Greek) in 1791. The reference at this time was the distance of the meridian from the north pole to the equator. One meter was set as 1/10,000,000 of this distance. Today, one meter is defined as <q>the distance that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second,</q> as defined in 1983.</p>
          <p>For navigation on water (marine), air, and space the <term>nautical mile</term> unit of length is used. Historically, a nautical mile was defined as the meridian arc length corresponding to one minute of a degree of latitude. Nautical mile is based on Earth’s circumference being 360 degrees. These degrees can then be divided into 60 minutes. One of these minutes (or minutes of arc as they are called in navigation) along a great circle on Earth represents one nautical mile. Today the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1,852 meters (6,076 ft; 1.151 mi).</p>
          <p>A nautical mile is slightly longer than a statute or land mile. This is because one degree of latitude is approximately 69 statute miles in length, so a nautical mile, 1/60th of that measure, is 1.15 statute miles.</p>
          <p>A <term>fathom</term> is nautical measurement equal to 6 feet or 1.8288 meters. It is commonly used for measuring depth in water, and is approximately the distance from finger tip to finger tip when your arms are outstretched.</p>

          <title>Length</title>
          <introduction>
            <p><term>Length</term> is a measure of the distance between two points. It is a fundamental dimension used to quantify the size or extent of objects, distances between locations, and dimensions in space.</p>

          <subsubsection xml:id="">
            <title>Length Units</title>
            <p>In the US standard system, the inch (in) 1" (double apostrophe) is the primary unit, with the foot (ft) 1' (single apostrophe), yard (yd) and mile (mi) used for larger distances.</p>
            <p>In the metric system, the base unit for length is the meter (m). Its subdivisions include the centimeter (cm), millimeter (mm). The kilometer (km), equivalent to 1,000 m is used for longer distances.</p>
            <p>The <term>Nautical Mile</term> (NM) is used as a unit of length for marine navigation.   The nautical mile was originally defined as one minute of latitude along any meridian. This unit is particularly useful for navigation because it makes it easier to calculate distances on maps and charts that use latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>

Lasers are focused beams of light that stay at a particular frequency. And because they travel from one place to another at a fairly constant rate, they can be used to measure distance with a great deal of accuracy. A laser measuring device also has a longer range than many other measuring tools, which gives it an advantage over other devices that become less precise the farther out you measure. Lasers are less likely to disperse than white light, so they can travel at a greater distance without losing their intensity. They keep most of their intensity once they reflect off a target, which is important if you want to get accurate distance measurements.</p>

            <p>These are many different units  for measuring volume in use, including different units for dry and wet materials.  Here we will focus on those volume units relevant to shipboard operations.</p>
            <paragraphs>
              <title>US Standard Units</title>
              <p>In the US standard system, volume is typically measured in cubic feet ( <m>\ft{1}^3</m> ) or cubic inches ( <m>\inch{1}^3</m> ).</p>
              <p>The <term>fluid ounce</term> is commonly used for measuring small liquid volumes, especially for cooking. 1 fluid ounce is about 1.80 cubic inches.  The <term>gallon</term> is a larger unit of liquid volume, equal to 128 fluid ounces. 1 US gallon has a volume of 231 cubic inches.</p>
              <p>The volume of a <term>barrel</term> depends on the type of barrel, so a beer barrel,  a whiskey barrel, and an oil barrel are all different.  In the marine and petroleum industries, a barrel means an <term>oil barrel</term> (bbl).  The standard size for an oil barrel is 42 US gallons (approximately 159 liters).  Many liquid products are shipped in <term>drums</term> .  The most common sided drum can hold approximately 55 US gallons of liquid, which is roughly equivalent to 208 liters.</p>

              <p>The <term>liter</term> is commonly used for everyday measurements of liquid volumes. One liter is equal to 1 cubic decimeter. The <term>milliliter</term> is a smaller unit used for precise measurements of liquids.  One milliliter is equal to one-thousandth of a liter.</p>
              <p>The <term>cubic meter</term> (CBM or <m>\m{}^3</m> ) is the standard unit for larger volumes,  and is equal to the volume of a cube with sides of one meter.</p>

              <p>A <term>metric ton</term> (tonne)  is the mass of water which occupies <m>\m{1} \times \m{1} \times \m{1}</m> cube, and equals <m>\kg{1000}</m> .</p>
              <p>A <term>deadweight ton</term> is a measure of the weight of cargo a ship can safely carry.</p>
              <p>In transportation, the <term>Measurement Ton,</term> or <term>Shipping Ton</term> , is a volume measure equal to one cubic meter  ( <m>\m{}^3</m> or CBM) .  A CBM is used in the shipping and transportation industries to describe how much space a shipment takes up, <ie /> 1 cubic meter .  Note that the weight of one cubic meter of water is one metric ton, but the weight of one CBM of other material will vary depending on the material's density.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>To ensure that there is enough fuel and water to safely complete the voyage and not leave the ship stranded.</li>

              <title>Manual Sounding</title>
              <p>Many of the ship's tanks are sounded manually.</p>
              <p>All important tanks on ships are provided with <term>sounding tubes</term> , tubes which extend from the top of the tank to the bottom.  A crew member can lower a flexible <term>sounding tape</term> down the tube to measure the level in the tank manually.  Sounding tapes are normally made of brass and steel, and consist of a spool, a flexible tape measure, and a weighted bob attached at the end of the tape.</p>
              <p>The sounding tape can be used in either of two ways.  An <term>innage</term> is a measurement from the top of the liquid to the bottom of the sounding tube, while an <term>ullage</term> is a measurement from the top of the sounding tube to the surface of the liquid. Either method will reveal how full or empty the tank is.</p>

              <p>An innage bob has a cupped end which will produce a "popping" sound when it is bounced on the liquid surface which can be heard from the top of the sounding tube.  When taking an image, try to locate the the top surface without dropping the tape too deep.</p>
              <p>An ullage bob has a pointed end, and is used by dropping the tape to the bottom of the tank and noting where the liquid (or cut)  line appears, much like using a dipstick in your car.  The cut line is easier to detect in oil tanks than in water tanks.  The ullage bob has a ruler marked on it, which can be used to measure the depth of any water at the bottom of oil tanks by coating the bob with chalk, which will change color if it enters water.</p>
              <p>When you finish using an ullage tape on an oil tank, you need to wipe the oil off of the length of the tape, which is one reason why an innage measurement may be preferred.</p>

              <p>Although knowing the tank level is sufficient for many purposes, the actual volume of the contents in gallons or tons can be looked up in the <term>Tank tables</term> .  These tables, which depend on the specific shape of each tank, relate tank level to volume. For highly accurate results, the list and trim of the ship and the temperature of the contents (which affects its density) must be taken into account.</p>

              <p>Many other methods of measuring liquid levels are available.  Some found  ship include:</p>
              <p><term>Gage glasses</term> , also known as <term>sight glasses</term> , provide a transparent window into the tank, allowing for direct visual observation of the liquid level inside.  The glass tube on a coffee urn is an example.</p>
              <p><term>Mechanical level gauges</term> use a float  attached to a pointer through a pulley system. As the liquid level changes, the float moves, causing the pointer to indicate the new level.</p>
              <p><term>Differential Pressure level gauges</term> measure the pressure difference between two points in the tank to determine the liquid level.</p>
              <p><term>Pneumercator</term> or <term>bubbler</term> gages operate based on hydrostatic pressure measurement. A bubbler system introduces a small amount of air at a near constant flow rate into the liquid through a dip tube to the bottom of the liquid. The pressure required to overcome the liquid head is measured and translated into a liquid level reading.</p>

              <p><term>Ultrasonic level gauges</term> function similarly to echo sounders. They emit ultrasonic waves from the gauge, which travel through the liquid and reflect off the surface. The sensor detects the time it takes for the echo to return, and a microprocessor then calculates the distance between the sensor and the liquid surface. These gauges are known for their accurate, non-contact measurement capabilities.</p>

        <title>Time</title>
        <introduction>
          <p><term>Time</term> is a fundamental and abstract concept that is used to order events, quantify the duration between events, and describe the progression of phenomena. It is one of the basic dimensions in the physical universe, along with length and mass.</p>
          <p>Measuring time began more than thirty thousand years ago. But back then, societies did not have clocks. Time was measured by the patterns of the moon, shadows of the sun, and the placement of the stars in the sky. These astronomical objects were widely used to determine time.</p>
          <p>Humankind’s need to gauge the divisions of the day and night led the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans to create sundials, water clocks, and other early chronometric tools. Western Europeans adopted these technologies, but by the 13th century, demand for a dependable timekeeping instrument led medieval artisans to invent the mechanical clock. Although this new device satisfied the requirements of monastic and urban communities, it was too inaccurate and unreliable for scientific application or navigation.</p>
          <p>Precision <term>chronometers</term> accurate enough to determine a ship's longitude were not developed until the mid 1700's.  These precision chronometers went on to play key roles in the Industrial Revolution and the advance of Western civilization.</p>

          <title>Time Units</title>
          <p>The units of time in use throughout the world are:</p>
          <p><term>Second</term> (s): The second is the base unit of time in the SI system. It was historically defined as <m>1⁄86400</m> of a day – this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours, then to 60 minutes per hour and finally to 60 seconds per minute (24 × 60 × 60 = 86400 seconds per day). This definition is not sufficiently accurate for many purposes because of irregularities in the earth's orbit around the sun, so the second is now formally defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation produced by the cesium-133 atom.</p>
          <p>For time intervals smaller than a second,  SI prefixes are used.  One millisecond is <m>10^{-3}</m> seconds; 1 microsecond is <m>10^{-6}</m> seconds; 1 nanosecond is <m>10^{-9}</m> seconds; and 1 picosecond is <m>10^{-12}</m> seconds.</p>
          <p><term>Minute</term> (min): One minute is equal to 60 seconds.</p>
          <p><term>Hour</term> (h): One hour is equal to 60 minutes or 3,600 seconds.</p>
          <p><term>Day</term> (d): One day is defined as 24 hours, or 86,400 seconds. It is based on the Earth's rotation period.</p>
          <p><term>Week:</term> A week consists of seven days.</p>
          <p><term>Month</term> : Months are somewhat arbitrary units of time that vary in length. The most common definitions are the calendar months, which have 28, 30, or 31 days.</p>
          <p><term>Year</term> (yr): A year is the time it takes for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun. It is approximately 365.25 days. <term>Decade</term> : A decade is a period of ten years.</p>
          <p><term>Century</term> : A century is a period of one hundred years.</p>
          <p><term>Millennium</term> : A millennium is a period of one thousand years.</p>
          <p>These units provide a way to express and measure various durations, from tiny fractions of a second to vast spans of time.</p>

          <p><em>a.m</em> . and <em>p.m.</em> are abbreviations of the Latin phrases <foreign>ante meridiem</foreign> and <foreign>post meridiem.</foreign> <foreign>Meridiem</foreign> refers the time when the sun is directly overhead, in other words, noon, while <foreign>ante</foreign> and <foreign>post</foreign> translate as <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> , so these terms literally mean <q>before noon</q> and <q>after noon.</q></p>
          <p>Note that noon is neither a.m. nor p.m. because noon can never be before or after itself. You can say “12:00 noon”  but this is a bit redundant; “noon” communicates all that is needed.</p>
          <p>Midnight is problematic:  What is meant by midnight Friday? It could mean either 12:00 a.m. or 12:00 p.m., depending on whether you consider midnight to be the beginning or ending of the day.

This system is used in contexts where clarity and precision in timekeeping are critical. It eliminates confusion  whether midnight is at the start or end of the day,  and simplifies calculations involving time intervals.</p>

          <p>In military time, each hour of the day is represented by a four-digit number between 0000 and 2400. No punctuation and no a.m. or p.m. designation are used. The first two digits represent the hour, and the second two digits represent the minute.  For example, 0030 means 12:30 a.m. , 1000 means 10:00 a.m., and 1615 means 4:15 p.m.</p>
          <p>When speaking the time, zeros are usually pronounced using <q>Zero</q> ,  or <q>Hundred</q> , but not <q>Thousand</q> , so 0030 would be pronounced <q>Zero Zero Thirty</q> , 1000 would pronounced <q>Ten Hundred.</q> , and 1615 would be pronounced <q>Sixteen Fifteen</q> .</p>
          <p>Midnight is the beginning of the new day, and is represented by 0000, while 2400 represents midnight at the end of the day and is equivalent to 0000 of the following day. 1200 represents noon. Times between 0000-1159 are before noon, and times between 1201-2400 are after noon.</p>

          <title>Decimal Time</title>
          <p>When performing navigational calculations, time intervals must be added and subtracted.  This is inconvenient and error prone when using the ordinary h:m:s (hours:minutes:seconds) system, so  minutes and seconds are expressed as a decimal fraction of an hour instead.  For example, six minutes is equivalent to one tenth of an hour.  This method is called <term>decimal time</term> .</p>

        <title>Mass and Force</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>Mass is a fundamental property of matter that quantifies the amount of substance within an object. It is a measure of an object's resistance to acceleration when a force is applied, and it also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other objects.  The greater the mass of an object, the heavier it is on earth and the more force is required to accelerate or decelerate it.</p>
          <p>Force is any action that tends to maintain, alter or distort the motion of a body.  Force can be caused by contact with another object, or due to the remote effects of gravity, magnetism, or other influences.  More simply, a force is a push or a pull.  One common example of force is weight, which is the effect of gravity on a mass.</p>

          <title>Mass Units</title>
          <p>The <term>pound</term> is the most commonly used unit for everyday measurements of mass in the United States. This unit is called the pound-mass (lbm) when necessary to distinguish the pound-force.</p>
          <p><term>Pound</term> (lb):   One pound of mass is approximately equal to \kg{0.453592} kilograms.</p>
          <p><term>Ounce</term> (oz): The ounce is a smaller unit of mass often used for finer measurements.  One ounce is 1/16 of a pound and approximately equal to 28.3495 grams.</p>
          <p>The base unit of mass in the  SI system is the <term>kilogram</term> .</p>
          <p><term>kilogram</term> (kg): One kilogram is approximately equal to \lbm{2.2046}.</p>
          <p><term>Gram</term> (g): The gram is a smaller unit of mass frequently used for lighter objects or more precise measurements. One kilogram is equivalent to 1,000 grams.</p>
          <p><term>Milligram</term> (mg): The milligram is an even smaller unit used for very small masses, often in scientific and medical contexts. One gram is equivalent to 1,000 milligrams.</p>
          <p><term>Microgram</term> (µg): The microgram is an even smaller unit used for extremely small masses, especially in fields like chemistry and pharmacology. One microgram is equivalent to 0.001 milligrams.</p>

          <title>Properties of Mass</title>
          <p>Here are the key properties and characteristics of mass:</p>
          <paragraphs>
            <title>Intrinsic Property</title>
            <p>Mass is an invariant, intrinsic property of an object, meaning it does not change regardless of the object's location or the external forces acting on it. This is in contrast to weight, which varies from place to place depending on the gravitational field strength.</p>
          </paragraphs>
          <paragraphs>
            <title>Conservation of Mass</title>
            <p>The principle of the conservation of mass states that in a closed system, the total mass remains constant over time, regardless of the processes occurring within the system.</p>
          </paragraphs>
          <paragraphs>
            <title>Inertia</title>
            <p>Mass is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its motion. The greater the mass, the more force is required to change its state of motion (i.e., to accelerate it).  This relation is expressed by Newton's Second law of motion: <me>F = ma</me> .</p>
          </paragraphs>
          <paragraphs>
            <title>Gravitational Attraction</title>
            <p>Mass is the source of gravitational attraction. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the force of attraction between two masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. <me>F=G\frac {m_1m_2}{r^2}</me> where <m>F</m> is the gravitational force acting between two objects, <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m> are the masses of the objects, <m>r</m> is the distance between the object, and <m>G</m> is the universal gravitational constant.</p>

            <title>Equivalence of Mass and Energy</title>
            <p>According to Einstein's theory of relativity, mass and energy are equivalent and can be converted into each other. This is expressed in Einestein's famous equation <me>E=mc^2</me> .</p>

          <title>Force</title>
          <p>What is force? In simple terms, a force is a push or a pull.</p>
          <p>More precisely, a force is a vector quantity which tends to produce an acceleration of a body in the direction of its  application. This means that if you want a stationary object to move, you must apply a force  to it to get it going. If you want to keep it moving, you need to continuously apply a force  to it to overcome friction, which is itself a force. Forces can exist without motion too –  when an object is stationary it’s usually because there are many forces acting on it which  cancel each other out, leaving no net force acting on the object. Forces always occur in  pairs. A push on an object is always accompanied by an equal and opposite force acting on the  pusher.</p>
          <p>In the English system of units, force is measured in pounds, tons, or long tons.</p>
          <p>In the SI  system, force is measured in newtons ( <m>\N{}</m> )  or kilonewtons ( <m>\kN{}</m> ).  The newton is a derived unit, equal  to the product of mass and acceleration. <me>\N{} =  \mathrm{kg}\cdot  {\mathrm{m}}/{\mathrm{s}^2}</me></p>
          <p>For estimation purposes, a newton is about a quarter of a pound.</p>

          <title>Mass vs. Weight</title>
          <p>One important force which we experience every day is <term>weight</term> . A common misconception is that mass and weight are the same. They are not: weight is a <em>force</em> , not a <em>mass</em> .</p>
          <figure>
            <caption>Weight vs. Mass</caption>
            <image source="images/weight-v-mass.png" width="50%" />
          </figure>
          <p>Weight is the force of gravity - the attraction between an object and the earth. The force exerted on an object is  proportional to the mass of the object according to Newton’s second law, which states: <men xml:id="wmg">W=mg</men> , where <m>W</m> is weight, <m>m</m> is mass, and <m>g</m> is the local acceleration due to gravity.  Note that the weight of an object depends on both its mass <em>and</em> the acceleration of gravity acting on it.</p>
          <p>The value of <em>g</em> depends on where you are: on earth the constant is greater than it  is on the moon, so you weigh less on the moon than you do on earth. In outer space, the  constant is zero, making you weightless there.  The  mass of an object will not change when it moves to another location, but its weight may. For example, on the earth's surface, a one kilogram mass weighs about 2.2 pounds, but on Mars, the same mass would weigh only about 0.8 pounds, and on Jupiter it would weigh roughly 5.5 pounds.</p>
          <p>One reason why people often confuse weight with mass is because in the English system and on the  surface of the earth, the gravitational constant <em>g</em> is equal to 1, and so one pound of mass has a weight of one pound of force. Move to the moon, and the pound of mass now weighs  about six tenths of a pound. On earth in the SI system, <me>g = \aSI{9.8}</me> . Note the units of <m>g</m> .   This is a metric quantity; appropriate unit conversions must be made when working with US units. See the following examples.</p>

        <title>Torque</title>
        <introduction>
          <p><term>Torque</term> is the rotational equivalent of force. It is the measure of the tendency of a force to rotate an object around an axis of rotation. In simple terms, torque is the turning force that causes an object to rotate, turn or twist.</p>
          <figure>
            <caption>Example of Torque, Screwdriver turning a screw</caption>
            <image source="images/screwdriver-torque.png" width="50%" />
          </figure>
          <p>Different terms, including as <term>moment</term> or <term>moment of force</term> are interchangeably used to describe torque.</p>
          <p>Torque is a <term>vector quantity</term> , which means that a torque has both <term>magnitude</term> and <term>direction</term> .  These properties will be described in the next section.</p>
        </introduction>
        <subsection xml:id="">
          <title>Magnitude and Direction</title>
          <p>The <term>magnitude</term> of a torque describes how strongly it turns an object, in the same way that the magnitude of a force describes how hard it pushes on something. When you turn a door knob, the magnitude is how hard you twist the knob.  When you push on a door, the magnitude is the product of how hard you push and the distance from the hinges.</p>
          <p>Torque is produced by applying a force at some distance from center of rotation. The magnitude <m>T</m> is found by multiplying the applied  force <m>F</m> by the distance <m>d</m> between the force and the axis of rotation measured perpendicularly.

          <title>Types of Torque</title>
          <p><term>Static Torque</term> is required to initiate movement from a standstill or to stop an already moving object. It is the torque required to overcome the inertia of a stationary object and start its rotation. Static torque also occurs when tightening or breaking loose a bolt.</p>
          <p>Correct torque is crucial for bolted flanges to ensure a secure and leak-free connection. Applying the proper torque to the bolts on a flange ensures that the gasket is properly compressed, which prevents leaks and maintains the integrity of the joint.  Torque is related to bolt tightness, but many additional factors, such as friction, can have a significant impact on the relationship of torque to the tightness of the bolted joint.</p>

          <p><term>Dynamic Torque</term> refers to the twisting force that maintains an object’s constant rotational motion once it has started moving. This type of torque is used to accelerate or decelerate a moving object, such as a wheel or a motor. It’s the torque necessary to keep an object spinning at a steady rate, overcoming any frictional forces acting against it. Dynamic Torque is often used in the context of continually operating systems, like turbines in a power plant or motors in electric appliances.</p>

          <title>Torque Units</title>
          <p>Since torques are the product of a force with a distance, they have units of [force] <m>\times</m> [distance].</p>
          <p>In the US standard system, torque is typically measured in foot-pounds (ft-lb) or inch-pounds (in-lbs.). These units represent the amount of force applied at a specified distance from the rotational axis. For example, one foot-pound of torque is equal to a force of one pound applied at a distance of one foot from the axis of rotation.</p>
          <p>In the metric system, torque is measured in newton-meters (N-m) or in some cases, newton-centimeters (N-cm). The newton-meter represents the force (in newtons) applied at a distance of one meter from the rotational axis. Similarly, the newton-centimeter is the force (in newtons) applied at a distance of one centimeter from the axis of rotation.</p>

            <p>A <term>torque wrench</term> is a precision tool commonly used to apply a specific amount of torque to fasteners such as nuts and bolts. A torque wrench has a calibrated scale or a digital display that allows the user to set and control the applied torque accurately.</p>

            <p>Torque wrenches are used to apply precise amounts of torque to fasteners, ensuring they are neither too loose nor too tight. Over-tightening can strip threads or break fasteners, while under-tightening can lead to parts coming loose or failing to function properly. Manufacturers specify torque requirements for their products, and adhering to these specifications is often necessary to prevent damage and maintain warranties.</p>

          <title>Torque and Gear Ratios</title>
          <p>It is often necessary to increase or decrease the torque produced by a motor to suit different applications. Recall that the length of a <em>lever</em> can increase or decrease the force on an object at the expense of the distance through which the lever must be pushed. Similarly, the torque produced by a motor can be increased or decreased through the use of gearing. An increase in torque comes with a proportional decrease in rotational speed. The meshing of two gear teeth can be viewed as equivalent to the interaction of a pair of levers as shown in <xref ref="gear-ratio" /> .</p>
          <p>When a larger gear drives a smaller one, for one rotation of the larger gear the small gear must complete more revolutions - so the output will be faster than the input. If the situation is reversed, and a smaller gear drives a larger output gear, then for one rotation of the input the output will complete less than one revolution – so the output will be slower than the input. The ratio of the sizes of the two gears is proportional to the speed and torque changes between them.</p>

          <p>Speed and velocity are fundamental concepts that describe how fast objects move.</p>
        </introduction>
        <subsection xml:id="">
          <title>Speed</title>
          <p>
            <term>Speed</term>is a scalar quantity that describes how fast an object is moving. It is the rate at which an object covers distance. Speed does not have a direction; it only has magnitude. There are different ways to measure speed:
            <ul marker="">
              <li><term>Instantaneous Speed</term> is the speed of an object at a particular moment in time. Imagine looking at a car's speedometer at a specific instant; the reading is the car's instantaneous speed.</li>
              <li><term>Average Speed</term> the instantaneous speed averaged over a period of time. Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken to travel that distance. <me>\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}</me></li>
              <li><term>Rotational Speed</term> refers to how fast an object rotates or spins. It is often measured in revolutions per minute (RPM) or radians per second.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>A <term>knot</term> is a unit used to describe the speed of ships.  One knot is equal to one nautical mile per hour, which is approximately 1.15 miles per hour or 1.85 km/hour.</p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection xml:id="">
          <title>Velocity</title>
          <p><term>Velocity</term> is a vector quantity, which means it includes both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of velocity is speed.</p>
          <p>While speed tells you how fast an object is moving, velocity tells you how fast and in which direction. For example, a car moving north at 60 km/h has a different velocity than the same car moving south at 60 km/h, even though their speeds are the same.</p>

These units include pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, newtons per square meter.  Other pressure units such as  pascals, atmospheres, or, bars are defined in terms of the base units of force and area.

            <title>Atmospheric Pressure</title>
            <p>Air, which is all around us, has weight, and it presses against everything it touches. This pressure is called the absolute pressure of the atmosphere or the <term>atmospheric pressure</term> . This pressure is equal to the weight of a column of air extending from the earth to space divided by the area of the column.  In space, where there is no atmosphere the atmospheric pressure is zero, and this condition is known as a <term>perfect vacuum</term> .</p>

            <p>At sea level the average atmospheric pressure is sufficient to support a column of mercury (Hg) 760.0 millimeters or 29.92 inches, equivalent to approximately 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa. At higher elevations, the atmospheric pressure is less than at sea level. The <term>bar</term> is a unit of pressure equal to 100 kPa, which is just slightly less than 1 atmosphere.</p>
            <p>The device used to measure the pressure of the atmosphere is called a <term>barometer</term> , so the absolute pressure of the atmosphere is also known as the barometric pressure. When you hear a weather report, this is the value reported.</p>
            <p>The barometric pressure changes with weather conditions, but for most purposes aboard ship, this fact can be ignored, and we can assume that the atmospheric pressure is 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) or 760 mm Hg. at all times.  Notice, however, that the figure of 14.7 psia  represents the average atmospheric pressure at sea level, and does not represent the <em>actual</em> pressure of the atmosphere at a particular place or time.</p>

                <p>Since the absolute atmospheric pressure is always present, and acts on everything equally, we normally don’t even notice it.  Pressure gauges measure pressure up or down from atmospheric pressure, and an ordinary pressure gage reads zero when it is subjected to atmospheric pressure only.

            <p><term>Absolute pressure</term> is a pressure measurement on a scale that increases from zero, where zero corresponds to the vacuum of space. Absolute pressure is always higher than the corresponding gage pressure by the amount of the atmospheric pressure. For shipboard purposes, you can simply add 14.7 psi to the gage reading in psi to get the absolute pressure. For example, a gage pressure of 100 psig would be the same as an absolute pressure of 114.7 psia.</p>
            <p>We sometimes say <em>psig</em> to indicate gage pressure and other times we merely say <em>psi</em> . By common convention,  when pressure is given in psi, pounds per square foot, or similar units, gage pressure is assumed. The <q>g</q> (for gage) is added only when there is some possibility of confusion. Absolute pressure, on the other hand, is always expressed as pounds per square inch absolute (psia), pounds per square foot absolute (psfa), and so forth.</p>

              When measuring a vacuum, there are three possible methods.
              <ul>
                <li>When vacuum is measured starting with zero at perfect vacuum and increasing as pressure rises, then the greater the value, the smaller the vacuum. This is simply the <term>absolute pressure</term> scale.</li>
                <li>We can also measure pressure on a scale starting at zero at atmospheric pressure, and indicating negative values when the pressure is below atmospheric pressure. This is <term>gage pressure</term> scale, and what happens when a vacuum is applied to a standard pressure gage.</li>
                <li>And finally, we can measure vacuum on a scale starting with zero at atmospheric pressure and increasing as the vacuum increases. On this scale no vacuum would be indicated by 0 psig, and a perfect vacuum would be indicated by approximately 14.7 psi vacuum.  This is called the <term>vacuum</term> scale, this is the gage pressure with the negative sign removed.</li>

            <p>You will also find another kind of pressure unit, which appears to be a length. These units include inches of water, inches of mercury (Hg), or the height of some other liquid of known density. These units, while measured in length units, still represent a pressure. The length describes the pressure exerted by a column of liquid of the given height, and is known as the <em>head</em> .</p>
            <p>For example, a pressure reading of 1 inch of water (1 in.

Similarly, a reading of 12 inches of mercury (12 in. Hg) means that the measured pressure is sufficient to support a column of mercury 12 inches high.</p>
            <p>What is really being expressed, even though it is not mentioned in the pressure unit, is the fact that a certain quantity of material (water, mercury, etc.) of known density will exert a certain definite force upon a specified area.

              <title />
              <p>A barometer is an instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure.  There are two basic types of barometers:</p>
              <p>The <term>mercury barometer</term> , which was invented by Evangelista Torricelli in 1643, consists of a glass tube, closed at one end and filled with mercury. The open end of the tube is placed in a reservoir of mercury. Atmospheric pressure pushes down on the surface of the mercury in the reservoir, causing the mercury in the tube to rise or fall. The height of the mercury column in the tube, usually measured in millimeters or inches, indicates the atmospheric pressure.  Mercury is used in barometers because its high density means the height of the column can be a reasonable size to measure atmospheric pressure.  A barometer using water, for instance, would need to be about 34 feet tall, while a mercury barometer less than three feet tall..</p>
              <p>The <term>aneroid barometer</term> contains a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid chamber, which is tightly sealed and partially evacuated of air. Changes in atmospheric pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. This movement drives levers and springs that move a needle on a dial to indicate the pressure reading. Aneroid barometers are more portable and durable than mercury barometers.</p>

              <title>Manometers</title>
              <p>A manometer is another pressure measuring  instrument. Unlike a barometer, which measures atmospheric pressure, a manometer is used to measure the pressure above or below atmospheric, or the pressure difference between two points.</p>
              <p>The manometer consists of a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, usually mercury or water.</p>
              <p>When the pressures on both sides of the manometer are equal, the fluid levels will equalize, but if two different pressures are applied , the levels  will adjust until the pressures are balanced by the weight of liquid in the higher leg.  The height difference ( <m>h</m> ) between the twp surfaces corresponds to the pressure difference.</p>
              <p>When one leg is open to the atmosphere, the pressure difference represents a gauge pressure.</p>

              <p>For a U-tube manometer the pressure difference <m>\Delta p</m> is calculated using the formula: <men xml:id="rho-g-h">\Delta p = \rho g h</men> where <m>\rho</m> is the density of the liquid in the manometer, <m>g</m> is the acceleration due to gravity, and <m>h</m> is the height difference between the liquid columns.</p>

            <title>Bourdon Tube Gauges</title>
            <introduction>
              <p>A <term>Bourdon tube pressure gauge</term> is a mechanical device used for measuring pressure.</p>
              <p>The key element is the Bourdon tube, a C-shaped tube typically made of metal such as brass, bronze, or stainless steel.  A Bourdon tube gauge relies on the elasticity and mechanical properties of the Bourdon tube to sense pressure.  When pressure is applied, the tube straightens or uncoils slightly.  This deformation is transmitted through a linkage and gear to a pointer, which moves across the calibrated dial to indicate the pressure.</p>
              <figure>
                <caption>Bourdon Tube Pressure Gauge</caption>
                <image source="images/bourdon-tube-guts.jpeg" width="40%" />
              </figure>
              <p>Bourdon tube gauges are simple, robust, and they require no external power. They are durable, capable of withstanding harsh environments and high pressures, and provide reasonably accurate readings for many industrial applications.  However, there are some limitations. Bourdon tube gauges can be sensitive to extreme temperatures, which may affect their accuracy. Over time, the moving parts may wear out, necessitating maintenance or replacement.  Additionally, they are not suitable for very low or very high-pressure measurements beyond their design specifications.</p>
              <p>All bourdon tube gauges measure <term>gage pressure</term> , that the indicator points to zero when they are connected to atmospheric pressure.  All other measurements are relative to this zero value.</p>
            </introduction>
            <paragraphs>
              <title>Types of Bourdon Tube Gauges</title>
              <p>Several types of Bourdon tube gauges are available for different applications.  Scales marked using various units are also available.</p>
              <p><term>Simplex Gauge</term> : This is a basic bourdon tube gauge, designed to measure positive pressures only.  The scale starts at atmospheric pressure on the left and rotates clockwise as the measured pressure increases.  A peg on the face prevents the pointer from moving below 0.  The gauge is a dual-scale model, with pressure indicated in both psig and kPa.</p>
              <figure>
                <caption>Simplex Pressure Gauge</caption>
                <image source="images/simplex-gage.jpg" width="40%" />
              </figure>
              <p><term>Vacuum gauge</term> : <term></term> Vacuum gages are designed to measure pressures below atmospheric only.  The scale starts at zero on the right and rotates counterclockwise as the absolute pressure decreases and the vacuum increases. The maximum values on the gauge corresponds to the maximum possible vacuum that can be achieved relative to the atmospheric pressure, approximately 30 inches or 760 mm of mercury vacuum. Note that the gauge below has dual scales:  inches of mercury vacuum and mm mercury absolute.</p>
              <figure>

                <image source="images/vacuum-gage.jpg" width="40%" />
              </figure>
              <p><term>Compound Gauge</term> :  These gauges can measure both positive and negative (vacuum) pressures, making them suitable for applications where both types of pressure need to be monitored. There is no distinct zero point on these gauges because it moves as the atmospheric pressure changes.  The pressure and vacuum scales are usually marked with different units.  On the gauge shown, positive pressures are in psi or bar, and vacuums are in inches mercury, and bars absolute.</p>

                <image source="images/compound-gage.jpg" width="40%" />
              </figure>
              <p><term>Differential  Gauge</term> :  This gauge is designed to measure the pressure difference between points.  Internally, there are two bourdon tubes, and the linkage is arranged to move the pointer based on the difference between them.  These gauges are recognizable because they have two pressure connections, but only one pointer.  Differential gauges are often used to measure the pressure drop across filters or strainers.  An increasing pressure drop is an indication that the strainer needs to be cleaned or the filter changed.</p>

                <image source="images/differential-gage.png" width="40%" />
              </figure>
              <p><term>Duplex Gauge</term> :  This type features two separate bourdon tubes and pointers within a single gauge housing, allowing simultaneous measurement of two different pressures.  Useful for displaying two different but related pressures simultaneously, for example the inlet and outlet pressures on a heat exchanger.</p>

              <title>Gage Calibration</title>
              <p><term>Gage calibration</term> involves comparing a gauge's readings against a known standard or reference to ensure accuracy and correct any discrepancies. Gages are initially calibrated at the factory, but they should also be recalibrated at regular intervals.  Recalibration helps to detect and correct drift, wear, or damage in the gauge, thus ensuring reliable performance. The frequency of recalibration depends on factors such as the gauge’s usage, the criticality of the measurements, and manufacturer recommendations.</p>
              <p>Two adjustments are usually made when performing a calibration.</p>
              <p><term>Zero Adjustment</term> : This is typically done first. The gauge is checked at no pressure, and adjustments are made to set the pointer at zero. This ensures that the gauge has no offset error.</p>
              <p><term>Span Adjustment</term> : After setting the zero point, the gauge is subjected to its maximum rated pressure to check the upper end of the scale. Adjustments are then made to ensure that the gauge reads accurately at this high-pressure point. This process might also include intermediate points to verify linearity across the span.</p>

            <p>A <term>capsule-type pressure gauge</term> is a device used to measure low-pressure ranges with high sensitivity and accuracy. They are only suited for low pressure measurements. They can be destroyed if they are exposed to high pressures or harsh conditions. They are commonly used to monitor and control air pressure in ventilation systems.</p>
            <p>The heart of the gauge is the capsule element, which is made up of two thin, corrugated diaphragms welded or sealed together at their edges to form a sealed capsule. This capsule expands and contracts in response to pressure changes.</p>

          <p>In interpreting pressure measurements, a great deal of confusion arises because the zero point on most pressure gages represents atmospheric pressure rather than zero absolute pressure, and several different pressure and head scales are used. Thus it is important to specify the kind of pressure being measured under given conditions as well as the desired units.</p>

        <introduction>
          <p>Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. It quantifies how hot or cold an object or environment is relative to a standard or reference point.</p>

          <title>Temperature Scales</title>
          <p>The most commonly used temperature scale in the US today is the <term>Fahrenheit</term> scale, abbreviated F. In this scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. (This only holds strictly when atmospheric pressure equals the average sea level pressure. At high altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature, as anyone who cooks in the mountains knows.)</p>
          <p>Another common scale is the <term>Celsius</term> scale. In this scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees.</p>
          <p>There are also temperature scales in which zero is <term>absolute zero</term> , the lowest possible temperature. (People have gotten close to absolute zero, but have never reached it. According to theory, we never will.) Absolute zero is at -273.15 Celsius, or -459.67 Fahrenheit.</p>
          <p>The <term>Kelvin</term> temperature scale uses the same size degree as Celsius, but has its zero set to absolute zero.</p>
          <p>The <term>Rankine</term> temperature scale uses the same size degree as Fahrenheit, but has its zero set to absolute zero</p>
          <p>The Celsius and Kelvin scales are part of the International System of Units (SI), providing a standardized and widely adopted system for expressing temperatures. Celsius is the more common scale for everyday use, while Kelvin is often used in scientific and thermodynamic calculations.</p>

          <title>Temperature Measuring Instruments</title>
          <p>Various instruments are used to measure temperature in different applications. The choice of temperature measurement instrument depends on factors such as the required accuracy, temperature range, and the specific application or industry. Different instruments are suitable for different temperature ranges and environments.</p>
          <p>Here are some common instruments used to measure temperature:</p>
          <p><term>Liquid in Glass Thermometers</term> are the most common instruments for measuring temperature.  The basic principle involves the expansion or contraction of a temperature-sensitive substance in response to temperature changes. This type of thermometer consists of a liquid (usually <em>mercury</em> or <em>colored alcohol</em> ) sealed in a glass tube. The liquid expands or contracts with temperature changes, and the temperature is read from a scale etched on the thermometer.</p>

          </figure>
          <p><term>Bimetallic temperature sensors</term> use the differential expansion of two metals to detect temperature changes. These are often used in thermostats and mechanical temperature gauges.</p>

            <image source="images/temperature-image3.png" width="30%" />
          </figure>
          <p>A <term>thermocouple</term> is a device which measures temperature using the <term>Seebeck effect</term> .  In 1821, Thomas Seebeck discovered that a voltage will be generated in a wire loop made from two dissimilar conductors when two junctions are maintained at different temperatures. The Seebeck effect is used to measure temperature with great sensitivity and accuracy .</p>
          <p>A thermocouple consists of two metal wires made of different materials, joined at one end to form a junction. The junction, called the <term>hot junction</term> , is placed where the high temperature is to be determined, while the other ends, called the <term>cold junction</term> ,  are maintained at a lower, stable temperature. The voltage difference between the wires at the cold junction is used to determine the temperature at the hot junction.</p>
          <p>Thermocouples are designated by letters and colors indicating the specific pairs of metals used.  The most common thermocouple types are J (black), K (yellow) and T (blue).  The choice of a thermocouple is based on the required  temperature range and accuracy.</p>

            <image source="images/thermocouple.png" width="50%" />
          </figure>
          <p>A <term>Resistance Temperature Detector</term> or <term>RTD</term> is a device that determines the temperature of an object by measuring the electrical resistance of a sensing element, The sensors resistance changes linearly as a function of temperature, increasing as the temperature rises and decreasing when the sensor cools.</p>
          <p>Most RTDs are either <term>wire wound</term> or <term>thin film</term> types Wire wound RTDs use a fine platinum wire wrapped around a glass or ceramic core, while thin film RTDs use a base ceramic element with a platinum track deposited on it. In either case, the sensing element normally housed in a protective probe to protect them from the environment they are immersed in and to make them more robust.</p>
          <p>
            While thermocouples and RTDs both measure temperature, there are several differences between the two methods, such as:
            <ol>
              <li>Thermocouples are usually smaller than RTDs, making them easier to use.</li>
              <li>Thermocouples (-200 to 2000°C) offer a wider range of temperature operation than RTDs (-200 to 600° C). This means that thermocouples are suitable for more applications.</li>
              <li>Thermocouples offer a response time between 0.1 and 10s which is faster than the response time of RTD sensors.</li>
              <li>RTDs can self-heat while this issue is negligible with the thermocouples.</li>
              <li>Thermocouplesare more sensitive than RTD temperature sensors. This is so because these react faster than RTDs with the variation in temperature.</li>
              <li>For thermocouples, the graph between resistance and temperature is not linear, while an RTD is linear.</li>
            </ol>

          <p>A <term>Thermistor</term> is a type of temperature-sensitive resistor whose electrical resistance changes significantly with temperature. It is commonly used in electronic devices and temperature control systems.</p>

          <p>An <term>Infrared (IR)</term> thermometer measures temperature without direct contact with the object. It detects the infrared radiation emitted by the object, and converts it into a temperature reading.</p>
          <p>IR thermometers are used for non-contact measurements, remote measurement, or in hazardous environments.</p>

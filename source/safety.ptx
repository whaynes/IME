   <introduction>
      <p>Ships are dangerous places to live and work for many reasons, some general, and some specific to the marine environment.  These include dynamic and unpredictable marine conditions, extended working hours with small crews, hazardous cargos, isolated work settings, and the potential for fire, explosion, collision, and sinking.</p>
      <p>Everyone aboard needs to be aware of the potential hazards, actively engage in safety measures, and be prepared to respond to emergencies.  Safety is not solely the responsibility of designated officers or management but is a collective responsibility shared by all onboard. </p>
      <p>In this chapter we discuss some of the hazards you may encounter aboard ship, approaches to managing and reducing risk, and some things you can do personally do to protect yourself, your shipmates, the vessel, and the environment.</p>

      <title>Hazards in the workplace</title>
      <introduction>
         <p>In any workplace, including aboard a ship, exposure to safety hazards is inevitable due to the nature of the work environment. These hazards can have serious repercussions such as injuries, operational disruptions, equipment damage, financial loss, environmental harm, and even loss of life. </p>
         <p>Identifying, addressing, and avoiding hazards is crucial to maintaining a safe working environment, protecting yourself and others. In this section we describe some common workplace hazards which you should be aware of.</p>
      </introduction>
      <subsection xml:id="safety-slips--trips-and-falls">
         <title>Slips, Trips and Falls</title>
         <p>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, slips, trips, and falls cause nearly 700 fatalities per year and many more injurious accidents in the workplace,</p>
         <p>Common trip and fall hazards include obstructions on walkways, such as cables, tools, or equipment left in pathways. Uneven surfaces, loose gratings, and obstructions, can also contribute to tripping incidents. Additionally, poor lighting, cluttered work areas, improper storage of materials, and inadequate lighting can increase the risk of trips and falls.  </p>
         <p>Spilled liquids, oils, or water can make surfaces extremely slippery. Wet surfaces due to cleaning or maintenance activities, and the presence of loose debris are additional factors that can contribute to slip incidents.</p>
         <p>Falls can be particularly dangerous when you are working at above the ground, such as on a ladder, scaffolding or staging.</p>
         <p>Falling objects such as tools, equipment, materials, or debris can potentially cause serious injuries or fatalities.  When tools and are stored haphazardly or left unsecured, they are susceptible to falling on someone. </p>
         <p>Aboard ship, additional hazards exist due to the dynamic and often wet environment. Obstructions such as hatch combings, pad-eyes and container hold-downs can cause individuals to trip. Slip hazards arise from seawater or rainwater on deck surfaces, spilled liquids in galley areas, or lubricants used for machinery maintenance.  In rough seas, the motion of the ship can cause unsecured objects to fall, or cause you to lose your balance and fall. You must be particularly careful when working at heights or over the side. Always follow the old adage, “one hand for the ship and one hand for yourself.</p>

         <title>Mechanical Hazards</title>
         <p>Mechanical hazards are a physical hazards associated with machines and other movable objects that may cause harm to a person.</p>
         <p>Injuries caused by mechanical hazards include friction or abrasion, lacerations, cutting, severing, pinching, crushing, or entanglement of body parts. Additionally, non-mechanical hazards such as chips, splashes, and sparks can injure you or others in the area.</p>
         <p>Mechanical hazards can be managed by adopting safe work procedures and the application of appropriate safeguards. As such, you should always wear appropriate PPE, follow the machine’s operating instructions, and ensure that all machine safety features and guards are in place. Be aware that some machines may start automatically at any time, so take appropriate precautions including de-energizing and locking out machinery before working on it.</p>

         </figure>
         <p>Here are some of the main hazards associated with electricity:</p>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Electrical Shock</title>
            <p>The most immediate and dangerous hazard of electricity is electrical shock. When a person comes into contact with an electrical current, it can pass through their body, causing electrical shock. Even low-voltage shocks can lead to muscle contractions, burns, and disruption of the body's electrical signals. High-voltage shocks can result in severe burns, organ damage, and cardiac arrest.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Electrical Fires</title>
            <p>Electrical malfunctions can generate heat and sparks, leading to electrical fires. Faulty wiring, overloaded circuits, damaged electrical cords, and short circuits are common causes of electrical fires. These fires can quickly spread and pose a significant risk to property and life. The combination of electricity and flammable materials increases the likelihood of a fire and makes it more challenging to extinguish.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Arc Flash and Arc Blast</title>
            <p>
               <term>Arc flash</term> refers to the release of intense heat, light, and energy that occurs during an electrical fault or short circuit. It is characterized by a sudden and violent discharge of electrical energy through the air. The arc flash generates extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit (19,400 degrees Celsius). The intense heat emitted during an arc flash can cause severe burns to anyone in its vicinity. Additionally, the arc flash produces a bright flash of light, which can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment.</p>
            <p>
               <term>Arc blast</term>, on the other hand, refers to the high-pressure shockwave produced by the rapid expansion of air during an arc flash. The rapid expansion of these vapors creates a blast wave that can cause significant physical damage. Arc blasts can result in powerful pressure waves, similar to those generated by an explosion, which can cause injuries, such as concussions, fractures, hearing loss, and even fatalities. The arc blast can propel debris, molten metal, and hot gases, further exacerbating the risk to individuals in the vicinity.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Electrical Burns</title>
            <p>Electrical burns occur when electric current passes through the body, generating heat. These burns can be internal or external, depending on the path the electricity takes. Electrical burns can cause extensive tissue damage and may require specialized medical treatment. The severity of electrical burns depends on the voltage, current, duration of contact, and the body's resistance.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Electrocution</title>
            <p>In the most severe cases, electric shocks can lead to electrocution, resulting in death. High-voltage shocks can cause cardiac arrest, severe internal injuries, and other life-threatening conditions. Contact with overhead power lines, unauthorized access to electrical panels or equipment, and improper handling of live wires are some situations that can lead to fatal accidents.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <assemblage xml:id="safety-effects-of-electrical-current-on-the-human-body">
            <title>Effects of Electrical Current on the Human Body</title>
            <p>The severity of an electrical shock depends on the current’s magnitude, the duration, the contact area, and the path taken by the current through the body.  In extreme cases the shock causes failure of the normal action of the heart and lungs resulting in unconsciousness or death.</p>
            <p>The shock current received obeys Ohm’s, so high voltages are always more dangerous.  But your body resistance is equally important.  Body resistance with dry skin may be above 100,000 ohms, However, if the skin is wet or broken, the body's resistance decreases to a few thousand ohms.</p>

         <p>Fatigue can impair an individual's ability to assess risks accurately and make sound judgments. This can result in poor decision-making, potentially leading to safety hazards or negative consequences in various aspects of life, including personal relationships and professional responsibilities.</p>
         <p>The IMO has developed guidelines for rest requirements to address the issue of fatigue among seafarers. These guidelines are outlined in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention). </p>
         <p>The STCW Convention sets out minimum hours of rest for seafarers. The standard requires that seafarers receive a minimum of 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period and a minimum of 77 hours of rest in any 7-day period. The hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, with one period being at least 6 hours in length.</p>
         <p>In situations where the safety of the ship, crew, or passengers is compromised, and in cases of emergencies or drills, the rest period may be temporarily shortened or interrupted. However, the seafarers should be provided with compensatory rest as soon as possible.</p>

         <p>Here are some hazards associated with confined spaces:</p>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Lack of oxygen</title>
            <p>Confined spaces often have limited ventilation, which can lead to a decrease in oxygen levels. This oxygen-deficient atmosphere can cause dizziness, loss of consciousness, or even asphyxiation.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Toxic gases and vapors</title>
            <p>Confined spaces may contain hazardous gases or vapors, such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, or volatile chemicals. These substances can accumulate in the confined space and pose a serious health risk to individuals who inhale them, leading to poisoning or respiratory problems.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Fire and explosion risks</title>
            <p>Confined spaces may contain flammable substances, inadequate electrical systems, or potential ignition sources. This combination can result in the rapid escalation of fire or explosion hazards, especially in spaces with limited airflow and potential fuel accumulation.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Engulfment or entrapment</title>
            <p>Confined spaces often have small openings or tight access points. If an individual becomes trapped or engulfed by materials, such as loose soil, water, or flowing grain, it can lead to serious injury, suffocation, or drowning.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Physical hazards</title>
            <p>Confined spaces may have uneven surfaces, protruding objects, or low ceilings, increasing the risk of slips, trips, falls, and head injuries. Limited visibility and restricted movement within the space can further contribute to accidents and make rescue difficult.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Extreme temperatures</title>
            <p>Some confined spaces can experience extreme temperatures due to insulation issues, lack of ventilation, or the presence of heat-generating equipment. Excessive heat or cold can cause thermal discomfort, heat exhaustion, hypothermia, or heat stroke.  </p>
            <p>Emergency repairs to boilers must sometimes be made before the boiler has had a chance to cool down.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <paragraphs>
            <title>Biological hazards</title>
            <p>In certain confined spaces, such as sewage tanks or areas with stagnant water, there may be an increased risk of exposure to bacteria, viruses, or mold, which can lead to respiratory issues, allergies, or infectious diseases.</p>
         </paragraphs>
         <p>For safe entry into a confined space, everyone involved should be properly trained on confined space entry and rescue techniques and strictly comply with all regulations and guidelines governing confined space entry. </p>
         <p>Begin by conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify potential hazards and establish necessary control measures. Inspect the equipment used for entry to guarantee its reliability. </p>
         <p>Ensure proper ventilation is in place, to maintain fresh air and remove hazardous substances. Test the atmosphere using gas detection equipment before entering to verify safe conditions. Wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protection and fall protection gear. </p>
         <p>Maintain proper lighting to ensure visibility within the confined space. Establish effective communication systems between individuals inside and outside the space. Designate a standby person outside the space, equipped with rescue training, to provide immediate assistance if required. </p>

      <subsection xml:id="safety-job-hazard-analysis">
         <title>Job Hazard Analysis</title>
         <p>A <term>job hazard analysis</term> (JHA), also known as a job safety analysis (JSA), is a systematic process used to identify and analyze potential hazards or risks associated with specific job tasks or activities. Its primary purpose is to reduce the risk of accidents by identifying potential hazards and developing appropriate controls to mitigate them.</p>
         <p>The process typically involves breaking down a job into its individual steps  and examining each step to identify potential hazards. Hazards can include physical hazards (e.g., machinery, equipment, or environmental conditions), chemical hazards (e.g., exposure to hazardous substances), biological hazards (e.g., exposure to infectious agents), ergonomic hazards (e.g., repetitive motion or lifting heavy objects), or any other factors that could pose a risk to worker safety and health.</p>
         <p>The key steps in conducting a job hazard analysis typically include: 
<ol>
               <li>Select the job or task to be analyzed.</li>
               <li> Break down the job into steps.</li>
               <li> Identify potential hazards for each step.</li>
               <li>
                  <p> Determine the risk level for each identified hazard.  Risk level multiplies severity and the likelihood of each identified hazard.</p>
               </li>
               <li> Develop hazard controls to eliminate or minimize the hazards. This might include engineering controls (e.g., machine guarding), administrative controls (e.g., training or procedures), or personal protective equipment (PPE)</li>
               <li> Communicate the findings to workers and stakeholders to ensure awareness and buy-in.</li>
               <li>Regularly review and update the job hazard analysis.</li>
            </ol>
         </p>
         <p>This results of the JHA can be shared with the crew during a <term>toolbox talk </term>in order to raise awareness about known hazards, reinforce safe work practices, and promote a culture of safety. These talks are usually conducted before the start of the work day.</p>
         <p>Systematically analyzing and communicating job hazards and implementing appropriate controls helps to create a safer workplace. </p>

      <title>Electrical Propulsion</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>Marine electric propulsion systems utilize generators to provide power for electric
          motors, which in turn drive the ship's propeller. The electric generators may be driven by
          any suitable prime mover, most commonly, diesel engines. While it may initially seem
          counterintuitive to interpose complex and costly equipment between the prime mover and the
          propeller when a simple line shaft and gearbox could transmit the power instead, there are
          valid justifications for the added complexity and expense. </p>
        <p>The advantages of electric propulsion are as follows:</p>
        <paragraphs>
          <title>Layout Flexibility</title>

          <p>One notable advantage of electric propulsion is the ability to install the prime mover
            in any convenient location, without being restricted to a direct line with the
            propeller. Power is transmitted through flexible cable runs, as opposed to rigid line
            shafts. Furthermore, instead of relying on a single large main engine, multiple smaller
            engines can be used, allowing for placement in smaller spaces and more convenient
            locations. </p>
        </paragraphs>

        <paragraphs>
          <title>Efficient operation</title>

          <p>Electric propulsion systems enable both the prime mover and the propeller to operate at
            their optimal speeds, eliminating the need for reduction gears. Typically, medium speed
            diesel engines are coupled with low-speed motors and propellers. The speed reduction is
            accomplished by selecting the appropriate number of motor poles, and the shaft speed
            (RPM) is established by adjusting the electrical frequency to the motor. This setup
            allows each component to operate within its most efficient range, maximizing overall
            energy efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.</p>
        </paragraphs>

        <paragraphs>
          <title>Economical Part-Load Operation</title>

          <p>By employing multiple generators operating in parallel, ships can secure one or more
            engines under reduced load conditions. The remaining engines can then operate at nearly
            full load, resulting in improved efficiency compared to having more engines operating at
            part-load. Load management systems continuously monitor the electrical demand and
            promptly initiate the startup of an additional generator when necessary.</p>
        </paragraphs>

        <paragraphs>
          <title>Redundancy and Reliability</title>

          <p> Electric propulsion systems provide inherent redundancy and enhanced reliability
            compared to traditional propulsion systems. With multiple smaller generator sets, the
            system can continue to function even if one or more generators or motors fail or require
            maintenance. This redundancy reduces the risk of complete propulsion failure and ensures
            that the propulsion system remains operational. </p>

          <title>Principle of operation</title>

          <p>An electrical generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy by utilizing
            the principle of <term>electromagnetic induction</term>. Electromagnetic induction was
            first discovered in the early 19th century by English scientist Michael Faraday (1791
            <ndash/> 1867) . According to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, a changing
            magnetic field induces an electric voltage in a nearby conductor. If the conductor forms
            a closed loop, an electric current will flow through it.</p>

          <p>A generator consists of two main components: a rotating part called the
              <term>rotor</term> and a stationary part called the <term>stator</term>. In a typical
            AC synchronous generator, the rotor carries the <term>field windings</term> which
            produce the magnetic field, and the stator carries the <term>armature windings</term>,
            where the voltage is induced. </p>
          <p>A direct current (DC) is passed through the rotor's field windings to create the
            magnetic field. The process of supplying electrical current to the field winding is
            known as <term>excitation</term>. Alternately, some generators use permanent magnets to
            supply the magnetic field, but this has the disadvantage that the field is not
            adjustable. The rotor is connected to a prime mover, such as a steam turbine or a diesel
            engine, and as it spins it produces a <term>rotating magnetic field</term>. </p>
          <p>The stator consists of multiple windings arranged in a specific configuration. The
            rotating magnetic field interacts with the stator windings, inducing a voltage across
            them. If the stator winding are connected to a closed circuit containing a load like a
            motor or resistor, the induced voltage drives current through the circuit and transmits
            power to load. </p>
          <p>The induced voltage is proportional to the speed of rotation and also the strength of
            the magnetic field, therefore the output voltage can be adjusted by controlling the
            excitation current. The frequency in Hz (cycles/sec) depends on the speed of rotation
            and the number of magnetic poles. <me> f = \frac{P \;n }{120}</me> where <ul marker="">
              <li><m>f</m> = frequency</li>
              <li><m>n</m>= speed </li>
              <li><m>P</m> = number of north/south pole pairs</li>
            </ul></p>
          <p>The induced voltage is typically generated at a fixed frequency, such as 60 Hz in the
            United States.</p>
          <p>To generate three-phase power, the stator is fitted with three windings arranged
            symmetrically, 120 degrees apart from each other. As the rotor rotates, the rotating
            magnetic field induces voltages into each stator winding in turn, generating three sine
            waves of voltage, equally spaced, shown in <xref ref="three-phase"/>. </p>

          <p>The pilot generator is used to supply current to the exciter field, making the main
            generator <term>separately excited</term>, as opposed to <term>self excited</term>,
            where the output of the main generator itself is used to supply power to the the exciter
            generator. The AC output voltage of the pilot generator varies with the rotor speed,
            however its output current is automatically adjusted by an Automatic Voltage Regulator
            (AVR) to maintain its rated output (terminal) voltage, regardless of the load changes. </p>
          <p>The pilot generator consists of stator and rotor part as shown in <xref
              ref="exciter_exploded"/> and <xrer ref="pilot_generator"/>. The rotor part carries
            sixteen permanent magnets bolted on the shaft with alternating polarities making this a
              <term>Permanent Magnet Generator</term> (PMG). The stator part is bolted on the
            bearing housing of non drive-end side of the generator and carries 3-phase wye-connected
            armature windings. The rotating magnets induce an AC voltage into the armature windings
            and three-phase rectifier attached to the stator converts the AC voltage to a DC
            voltage. </p>
          <p>The resulting DC voltage is used to create a stationary magnetic field in the exciter.
            In other words, the pilot generator excites the exciter, which in turn excites the main
            generator. </p>

<section xml:id='HazardsAboardshipandAshore'><title>Hazards Aboard ship and Ashore</title>
<introduction>
<p>Aboard ship and in other workplaces you will inevitably be exposed to safety hazards due to the nature of the work environment. These hazards may have severe consequences, including injuries, disruptions in operations, damage to equipment, financial loss, environmental damage, and loss of life. </p>
<p>Identifying, addressing and avoiding hazards is crucial to maintaining a safe working environment, protecting yourself and others. </p>
<p>In this section we describe some common hazards which you should be aware of.</p></introduction>

<subsection xml:id="Slipstripsandfalls" ><title>Slips trips and falls</title>
<p>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, slips, trips, and falls cause nearly 700 fatalities per year and many more injurious accidents in the workplace,</p>
<p>Common trip and fall hazards include obstructions on walkways, such as cables, tools, or equipment left in pathways. Uneven surfaces, loose gratings, and obstructions, can also contribute to tripping incidents. Additionally, poor lighting, cluttered work areas, improper storage of materials, and inadequate lighting can increase the risk of trips and falls.  </p>
<p>Spilled liquids, oils, or water can make surfaces extremely slippery. Wet surfaces due to cleaning or maintenance activities, and the presence of loose debris are additional factors that can contribute to slip incidents.</p>
<p>Falls can be particularly dangerous when you are working at above the ground, such as on a ladder, scaffolding or staging.</p>
<p>Falling objects such as tools, equipment, materials, or debris can potentially cause serious injuries or fatalities.  When tools and are stored haphazardly or left unsecured, they are susceptible to falling on someone. </p>
<p>Aboard ship, additional hazards exist due to the dynamic and often wet environment. Obstructions such as hatch combings, pad-eyes and container hold-downs can cause individuals to trip. Slip hazards arise from seawater or rainwater on deck surfaces, spilled liquids in galley areas, or lubricants used for machinery maintenance.  In rough seas, the motion of the ship can cause unsecured objects to fall, or cause you to lose your balance and fall. You must be particularly careful when working at heights or over the side. Always follow the old adage, “one hand for the ship and one hand for yourself.</p></subsection>

<subsection xml:id="MechanicalHazards" ><title>Mechanical Hazards</title>
<p>Mechanical hazards are a physical hazards associated with machines and other movable objects that may cause harm to a person.</p>
<p>Injuries caused by mechanical hazards include friction or abrasion, lacerations, cutting, severing, pinching, crushing, or entanglement of body parts. Additionally, non-mechanical hazards such as chips, splashes, and sparks can injure you or others in the area.</p>
<p>Mechanical hazards can be managed by adopting safe work procedures and the application of appropriate safeguards. As such, you should always wear appropriate PPE, follow the machine’s operating instructions, and ensure that all machine safety features and guards are in place. Be aware that some machines may start automatically at any time, so take appropriate precautions including de-energizing and locking out machinery before working on it.</p></subsection>

<subsection xml:id="ElectricalHazards" ><title>Electrical Hazards</title>
<p>Electricity is a powerful and essential source of energy, but it can cause severe injuries, fires, and even fatalities if not handled properly.  Understanding the hazards posed by electricity is crucial for practicing electrical safety.</p>
<p>Here are some of the main hazards associated with electricity:</p>
<paragraphs><title>Electrical Shock</title>

<p>The most immediate and dangerous hazard of electricity is electrical shock. When a person comes into contact with an electrical current, it can pass through their body, causing electrical shock. Even low-voltage shocks can lead to muscle contractions, burns, and disruption of the body's electrical signals. High-voltage shocks can result in severe burns, organ damage, and cardiac arrest.</p>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Electrical Fires</title>

<p>Electrical malfunctions can generate heat and sparks, leading to electrical fires. Faulty wiring, overloaded circuits, damaged electrical cords, and short circuits are common causes of electrical fires. These fires can quickly spread and pose a significant risk to property and life. The combination of electricity and flammable materials increases the likelihood of a fire and makes it more challenging to extinguish.</p>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Arc Flash and Arc Blast</title>

<p><term>Arc flash</term> refers to the release of intense heat, light, and energy that occurs during an electrical fault or short circuit. It is characterized by a sudden and violent discharge of electrical energy through the air. The arc flash generates extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit (19,400 degrees Celsius). The intense heat emitted during an arc flash can cause severe burns to anyone in its vicinity. Additionally, the arc flash produces a bright flash of light, which can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment.</p>
<p><term>Arc blast</term>, on the other hand, refers to the high-pressure shockwave produced by the rapid expansion of air during an arc flash. The rapid expansion of these vapors creates a blast wave that can cause significant physical damage. Arc blasts can result in powerful pressure waves, similar to those generated by an explosion, which can cause injuries, such as concussions, fractures, hearing loss, and even fatalities. The arc blast can propel debris, molten metal, and hot gases, further exacerbating the risk to individuals in the vicinity.</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Electrical Burns</title>

<p>Electrical burns occur when electric current passes through the body, generating heat. These burns can be internal or external, depending on the path the electricity takes. Electrical burns can cause extensive tissue damage and may require specialized medical treatment. The severity of electrical burns depends on the voltage, current, duration of contact, and the body's resistance.</p>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Electrocution</title>

<p>In the most severe cases, electric shocks can lead to electrocution, resulting in death. High-voltage shocks can cause cardiac arrest, severe internal injuries, and other life-threatening conditions. Contact with overhead power lines, unauthorized access to electrical panels or equipment, and improper handling of live wires are some situations that can lead to fatal accidents.</p></paragraphs>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="ChemicalHazards" ><title>Chemical Hazards</title>
<p>Chemicals can pose significant risks to human health and safety.  By identifying and understanding the potential hazards, following proper storage and handling procedures, and adhering to safety protocols, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with hazardous chemicals and create a safer environment for everyone.</p>
<paragraphs><title>Chemical Exposure</title>

<p>You may be exposed to hazardous chemicals through inhalation, skin contact, or ingestion. Prolonged exposure or exposure to high concentrations can lead to adverse health effects such as respiratory issues, skin irritation, chemical burns, organ damage, or even long-term illnesses. </p>
<p>You should be aware of the hazardous chemicals present in your workplace, handle them safely and take precautions to minimize exposure, such as using proper ventilation systems, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), and following established protocols.  </p>
<p>You can learn about the potential risks associated with a chemical, as well as instructions on how to handle and respond to accidents or exposures, in the <term>Material Safety Data Sheet</term> (MSDS), which is required to be available in your workplace. MSDSs are typically created by the manufacturer or supplier of the chemical and are designed to ensure the safe use, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances.</p>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Chemical Storage</title>

<p>Chemicals that are improperly stored or incompatible substances stored in close proximity can react with one another, causing fires, explosions, or the release of toxic gases. Inadequate storage practices may also result in spills, leaks, or contamination, endangering both employees and the environment. </p>
<p>It is essential to follow proper storage procedures, including segregating incompatible chemicals, labeling containers correctly, ensuring proper ventilation and temperature control, and implementing appropriate containment measures such as spill kits and secondary containment systems.  The MSDS will contain instructions regarding proper storage.</p>
<p>In particular, aboard ship chemical containers must always be secured so that they don’t break free and cause accidents during heavy weather.   </p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Handling and Transporation</title>

<p> Improper handling of hazardous chemicals, such as careless pouring, transferring chemicals without suitable protective measures, or failure to follow established protocols, can result in spills, splashes, or exposure.  </p></paragraphs>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="Fire" ><title>Fire </title>

<p>Fire aboard ship is an ever-present threat that can swiftly escalate into a catastrophic disaster. With limited means of escape, a ship becomes a confined space where flames can spread rapidly, fueled by combustible materials and confined by its structure. </p>
<p>The close quarters, complex layout, and intricate ventilation systems aboard ship create formidable challenges for the ship’s small firefighting team. In addition to the immediate threat to human lives, a shipboard fire poses a significant risk to the environment, as toxic smoke, potential oil spills, and the release of hazardous substances can wreak havoc on marine ecosystems. </p>
<p>Effective fire prevention measures, comprehensive emergency response plans, rigorous training, and state-of-the-art firefighting equipment are crucial in mitigating this threat and ensuring the safety of everyone on board.</p>
<p>Fire prevention measures play a vital role in minimizing the risk of fire and maintaining a safe environment aboard ship. These measures encompass a range of proactive strategies aimed at preventing fires from starting or spreading. One fundamental aspect is implementing rigorous safety protocols and adhering to international standards, such as the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) regulations for fire safety.</p>
<p>Some key fire prevention measures include:

<li><p> <em>Fire Suppression Systems.</em> Equipping ships with reliable fire suppression systems, such as fixed CO2 or water mist systems, can effectively control and extinguish fires. These systems are designed to release the appropriate extinguishing agent in the affected area, limiting the fire's spread.</p></li>

<li><p> <em>Proper Storage and Handling</em>. Storing flammable materials in designated areas and following strict protocols for their handling reduces the risk of accidental ignition. Implementing proper waste management procedures and ensuring the availability of suitable fire-resistant containers also contribute to fire prevention efforts.</p></li>

<li><p> <em>Structural Fire Protection.</em> Regulations require fire-resistant materials and insulation in the ship's construction helps to contain fires and slow down their progression. Fire-resistant doors, bulkheads, and insulation compartmentalize the vessel, preventing the rapid spread of flames.</p></li>

<li><p> <em>Emergency Preparedness.</em> Developing and regularly reviewing comprehensive emergency response plans specific to fire incidents is crucial. This includes establishing evacuation procedures, assigning roles and responsibilities to crew members, and conducting fire drills to ensure everyone knows how to respond swiftly and effectively in an emergency.</p></li>

</ul></p>
<p>By implementing robust fire prevention measures, ships can significantly reduce the risk of fire, enhance the crew's safety, and protect the marine environment from potential devastation.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="Fatigue" ><title>Fatigue</title>

<p>Fatigue, which refers to a state of extreme tiredness and lack of energy, can pose several risks.   The primary cause of fatigue is insufficient or poor-quality sleep.  To avoid fatigue, it's important to prioritize adequate rest and sleep, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Other factor which can contribute to fatigue include: medical conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, anemia, and thyroid disorders; depression and anxiety, and unhealthy lifestyle habits, including inadequate physical activity, poor nutrition, excessive caffeine or alcohol intake, and smoking. Certain medications have fatigue as a side effect. </p>
<p>The negative consequences of fatigue include:</p>
<paragraphs><title>Impaired cognitive function</title>

<p>Fatigue can significantly impair cognitive abilities, including attention, concentration, memory, and decision-making. This can lead to reduced performance and increased errors, particularly in tasks that require sustained focus or critical thinking, such as driving, operating machinery, or performing complex work.</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Decreased alertness and reaction time</title>

<p>Fatigue can slow down reaction times and impair alertness, making it more challenging to respond quickly and appropriately to stimuli or unexpected events. This can increase the risk of accidents, both in occupational settings and during activities like driving or operating heavy equipment.</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Increased risk of accidents and injuries</title>

<p>Fatigue-related impairment can lead to an increased risk of accidents and injuries across various domains, including workplaces, roadways, and other high-risk environments. Fatigue-related accidents have been linked to major incidents in industries such as transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing.</p></paragraphs>

<p>Fatigue can impair an individual's ability to assess risks accurately and make sound judgments. This can result in poor decision-making, potentially leading to safety hazards or negative consequences in various aspects of life, including personal relationships and professional responsibilities.</p></paragraphs>

<p>The IMO has developed guidelines for rest requirements to address the issue of fatigue among seafarers. These guidelines are outlined in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention). </p>
<p>The STCW Convention sets out minimum hours of rest for seafarers. The standard requires that seafarers receive a minimum of 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period and a minimum of 77 hours of rest in any 7-day period. The hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, with one period being at least 6 hours in length.</p>
<p>In situations where the safety of the ship, crew, or passengers is compromised, and in cases of emergencies or drills, the rest period may be temporarily shortened or interrupted. However, the seafarers should be provided with compensatory rest as soon as possible.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="ConfinedSpaces" ><title>Confined Spaces</title>

<p>A confined space is defined by OSHA as a space that has limited or restricted means of entry, is not designed for continuous occupancy, and is large enough and configured so that a person can enter the space and maneuver well enough to perform tasks.  </p>
<p>Confined spaces pose several hazards that can endanger workers who enter  them due to their limited entry and exit points, restricted airflow, and potential for hazardous atmospheres. </p>
<p>On ships, some examples of confined spaces include:  Cargo and fuel tanks, cofferdams, pressure vessels, sewage tanks, and void spaces. </p>
<p>Here are some hazards associated with confined spaces:</p>
<paragraphs><title>Lack of oxygen</title>

<p>Confined spaces often have limited ventilation, which can lead to a decrease in oxygen levels. This oxygen-deficient atmosphere can cause dizziness, loss of consciousness, or even asphyxiation.</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Toxic gases and vapors</title>

<p>Confined spaces may contain hazardous gases or vapors, such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, or volatile chemicals. These substances can accumulate in the confined space and pose a serious health risk to individuals who inhale them, leading to poisoning or respiratory problems.</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Fire and explosion risks</title>

<p>Confined spaces may contain flammable substances, inadequate electrical systems, or potential ignition sources. This combination can result in the rapid escalation of fire or explosion hazards, especially in spaces with limited airflow and potential fuel accumulation.</p>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Engulfment or entrapment</title>

<p>Confined spaces often have small openings or tight access points. If an individual becomes trapped or engulfed by materials, such as loose soil, water, or flowing grain, it can lead to serious injury, suffocation, or drowning.</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Physical hazards</title>

<p>Confined spaces may have uneven surfaces, protruding objects, or low ceilings, increasing the risk of slips, trips, falls, and head injuries. Limited visibility and restricted movement within the space can further contribute to accidents and make rescue difficult.</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Extreme temperatures</title>

<p>Some confined spaces can experience extreme temperatures due to insulation issues, lack of ventilation, or the presence of heat-generating equipment. Excessive heat or cold can cause thermal discomfort, heat exhaustion, hypothermia, or heat stroke.  </p>
<p>Emergency repairs to boilers must sometimes be made before the boiler has had a chance to cool down.</p>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Biological hazards:</title>

<p>In certain confined spaces, such as sewage tanks or areas with stagnant water, there may be an increased risk of exposure to bacteria, viruses, or mold, which can lead to respiratory issues, allergies, or infectious diseases.</p>

<subsection xml:id="JobHazardAnalysis" ><title>Job Hazard Analysis</title>
<p>A <term>job hazard analysis</term> (JHA), also known as a job safety analysis (JSA), is a systematic process used to identify and analyze potential hazards or risks associated with specific job tasks or activities. Its primary purpose is to reduce the risk of accidents by identifying potential hazards and developing appropriate controls to mitigate them.</p>
<p>The process typically involves breaking down a job into its individual steps  and examining each step to identify potential hazards. Hazards can include physical hazards (e.g., machinery, equipment, or environmental conditions), chemical hazards (e.g., exposure to hazardous substances), biological hazards (e.g., exposure to infectious agents), ergonomic hazards (e.g., repetitive motion or lifting heavy objects), or any other factors that could pose a risk to worker safety and health.</p>
<p>The key steps in conducting a job hazard analysis typically include: 
<ol>
<li>Select the job or task to be analyzed.</li>
<li> Break down the job into steps.</li>
<li> Identify potential hazards for each step.</li>
<li><p> Determine the risk level for each identified hazard.  Risk level multiplies severity and the likelihood of each identified hazard.</p></li>

<li> Develop hazard controls to eliminate or minimize the hazards. This might include engineering controls (e.g., machine guarding), administrative controls (e.g., training or procedures), or personal protective equipment (PPE)</li>
<li> Communicate the findings to workers and stakeholders to ensure awareness and buy-in.</li>
<li>Regularly review and update the job hazard analysis.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>This results of the JHA can be shared with the crew during a <term>toolbox talk </term>in order to raise awareness about known hazards, reinforce safe work practices, and promote a culture of safety. These talks are usually conducted before the start of the work day.</p>
<p>Systematically analyzing and communicating job hazards and implementing appropriate controls helps to create a safer workplace. </p>

<li> <title>Practice Safe Lifting Techniques</title>

<p>To lift heavy objects safely, follow these guidelines:</p>
<p>Assess the object's weight and plan your lift accordingly. Warm up your muscles with light exercises. Stand close to the object with feet shoulder-width apart, keeping your back straight and bending at the knees. Get a firm grip on the object and lift using the strength of your legs, not your back. Avoid twisting and keep the object close to your body. </p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Prioritize safety and listen to your body to prevent injuries.</p></li>
<li> <title>Maintain Personal Fitness and Well-being</title>

<p>Ensure you are physically and mentally fit for the tasks assigned to you. Get enough rest, eat well, and stay hydrated. Fatigue and exhaustion can compromise your alertness and increase the risk of accidents.  Don’t abuse alcohol or drugs, and certainly don’t attempt to perform your duties when you’re impaired.</p></li>
<li> <title>Follow Emergency Procedures</title>

<p>Familiarize yourself with the ship's emergency procedures, including evacuation routes, muster stations, and the proper use of life-saving equipment. Be prepared to respond calmly and promptly in case of an emergency.</p></li>
<li> <title>Practice Good Communication</title>

<p>Safety is a team effort. Maintain open and effective communication with your fellow crew members.  Share safety-related information, ask questions, and seek clarification when needed. Don’t hesitate to speak up if you notice safety hazards, near misses, or unsafe practices.  Effective communication is essential for preventing, addressing and resolving safety issues promptly.</p>
</li>
<li> <title>Learn Continuously</title>

<p>Stay proactive in expanding your safety knowledge and skills. Participate in safety training programs, attend safety briefings, and stay updated on safety regulations and best practices. Take safety drills seriously.  The more informed you are, the better equipped you will be to protect yourself contribute to a safe working environment.</p></li>
</ul></p>
<p>By following these safety practices, you will not only protect yourself but also contribute to the overall safety of the crew and the smooth operation of the ship. Remember, safety should always be your top priority.</p></section>

  "body": " Unit-factor Method  The unit-factor method or the unity bracket method is a widely used metod for unit conversions using the rules of algebra. This method utilizes the fact that any number or expression can be multiplied by one (unity) without changing its value. The advantage of this method is that it explicitly accounts for units, rather than treating a conversion factor as a magic number .  To use this method, conversion factors are expressed as fraction equal to one , and multiplied against the original value while keeping careful track of the units in each term. Multiplying a value by a unit-factor and canceling any dimensional units appearing in both the numerator and denominator will express the original quantity in different units.  For example, since , dividing both sides by inch gives the unit-factor .  To convert inches to cm, just multiply by inches by the appropriate unit-factor, and cancel the inch units that appear in both the numerator and denominator.     To convert from cm to inches, use the reciprocal of this unit-factor, which is also unity.     Thus ( ) is a bit shorter than a meter ( ), and is a little more than   Unit conversion is often easier within the the SI system, since the relations between units are logical, and the prefixes increase or decrease by , so unit conversions can often be done in your head.  Several different conversion factors can be applied sequentially or simultaneously until only the desired set of dimensional units remains. This way, you only need to remember a few common conversion factors to make many different conversions. Here are some relations that you should remember:   With these values we can find the conversion factor between miles per hour and meters per second, as shown in the next example.  More conversion factors available in the appendix or online.   Distance Conversion   How many feet are there in a kilometer?

And because they travel from one place to another at a fairly constant rate, they can be used to measure distance with a great deal of accuracy. A laser measuring device also has a longer range than many other measuring tools, which gives it an advantage over other devices that become less precise the farther out you measure. Lasers are less likely to disperse than white light, so they can travel at a greater distance without losing their intensity. They keep most of their intensity once they reflect off a target, which is important if you want to get accurate distance measurements.

Regular sounding and monitoring tank levels is required for the safe operation of the vessel many reasons, including:  To ensure that there is enough fuel and water to safely complete the voyage and not leave the ship stranded.  To avoid spills caused by overfilling tanks.  To maintain the ship's stability, which depends on the location and weight of the tank contents, and is degraded by the free surface of partially filled tanks.  To determine when to refill service tanks as the contents are consumed.  To plan for bunkering and taking on cargo.  To detect leaks or loss of content from the tank.       Manual Sounding  Many of the ship's tanks are sounded manually.  All important tanks on ships are provided with sounding tubes , tubes which extend from the top of the tank to the bottom. A crew member can lower a flexible sounding tape down the tube to measure the level in the tank manually. Sounding tapes are normally made of brass and steel, and consist of a spool, a flexible tape measure, and a weighted bob attached at the end of the tape.  The sounding tape can be used in either of two ways. An innage is a measurement from the top of the liquid to the bottom of the sounding tube, while an ullage is a measurement from the top of the sounding tube to the surface of the liquid. Either method will reveal how full or empty the tank is.   Innage and Ullage measurements    An innage bob has a cupped end which will produce a \"popping\" sound when it is bounced on the liquid surface which can be heard from the top of the sounding tube. When taking an image, try to locate the the top surface without dropping the tape too deep.  An ullage bob has a pointed end, and is used by dropping the tape to the bottom of the tank and noting where the liquid (or cut) line appears, much like using a dipstick in your car. The cut line is easier to detect in oil tanks than in water tanks. The ullage bob has a ruler marked on it, which can be used to measure the depth of any water at the bottom of oil tanks by coating the bob with chalk, which will change color if it enters water.  When you finish using an ullage tape on an oil tank, you need to wipe the oil off of the length of the tape, which is one reason why an innage measurement may be preferred.   Sounding Tape and Sounding Bobs       Although knowing the tank level is sufficient for many purposes, the actual volume of the contents in gallons or tons can be looked up in the Tank tables . These tables, which depend on the specific shape of each tank, relate tank level to volume. For highly accurate results, the list and trim of the ship and the temperature of the contents (which affects its density) must be taken into account.    Level Meaurement  Many other methods of measuring liquid levels are available. Some found ship include:   Gage glasses , also known as sight glasses , provide a transparent window into the tank, allowing for direct visual observation of the liquid level inside. The glass tube on a coffee urn is an example.   Mechanical level gauges use a float attached to a pointer through a pulley system. As the liquid level changes, the float moves, causing the pointer to indicate the new level.   Differential Pressure level gauges measure the pressure difference between two points in the tank to determine the liquid level.   Pneumercator or bubbler gages operate based on hydrostatic pressure measurement. A bubbler system introduces a small amount of air at a near constant flow rate into the liquid through a dip tube to the bottom of the liquid. The pressure required to overcome the liquid head is measured and translated into a liquid level reading.   Pneumercator (Bubbler) Gage     Ultrasonic level gauges function similarly to echo sounders. They emit ultrasonic waves from the gauge, which travel through the liquid and reflect off the surface. The sensor detects the time it takes for the echo to return, and a microprocessor then calculates the distance between the sensor and the liquid surface. These gauges are known for their accurate, non-contact measurement capabilities.   "

  "body": " Time Units  The units of time in use throughout the world are:   Second (s): The second is the base unit of time in the SI system. It was historically defined as of a day – this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours, then to 60 minutes per hour and finally to 60 seconds per minute (24 × 60 × 60 = 86400 seconds per day). This definition is not sufficiently accurate for many purposes because of irregularities in the earth's orbit around the sun, so the second is now formally defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation produced by the cesium-133 atom.  For time intervals smaller than a second, SI prefixes are used. One millisecond is seconds; 1 microsecond is seconds; 1 nanosecond is seconds; and 1 picosecond is seconds.   Minute (min): One minute is equal to 60 seconds.   Hour (h): One hour is equal to 60 minutes or 3,600 seconds.   Day (d): One day is defined as 24 hours, or 86,400 seconds. It is based on the Earth's rotation period.   Week: A week consists of seven days.   Month : Months are somewhat arbitrary units of time that vary in length. The most common definitions are the calendar months, which have 28, 30, or 31 days.   Year (yr): A year is the time it takes for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun. It is approximately 365.25 days. Decade : A decade is a period of ten years.   Century : A century is a period of one hundred years.   Millennium : A millennium is a period of one thousand years.  These units provide a way to express and measure various durations, from tiny fractions of a second to vast spans of time.   Units of Time    "

Note that noon is neither a.m. nor p.m. because noon can never be before or after itself. You can say “12:00 noon” but this is a bit redundant; “noon” communicates all that is needed.  Midnight is problematic: What is meant by midnight Friday? It could mean either 12:00 a.m. or 12:00 p.m., depending on whether you consider midnight to be the beginning or ending of the day. This is why watch bills take effect at 12:01 a.m. and why airline flights leave at 11:59 p.m. or 12:01 a.m. but not midnight.

It eliminates confusion whether midnight is at the start or end of the day, and simplifies calculations involving time intervals.   24 hour clock    In military time, each hour of the day is represented by a four-digit number between 0000 and 2400. No punctuation and no a.m. or p.m. designation are used. The first two digits represent the hour, and the second two digits represent the minute. For example, 0030 means 12:30 a.m. , 1000 means 10:00 a.m., and 1615 means 4:15 p.m.  When speaking the time, zeros are usually pronounced using Zero , or Hundred , but not Thousand , so 0030 would be pronounced Zero Zero Thirty , 1000 would pronounced Ten Hundred. , and 1615 would be pronounced Sixteen Fifteen .  Midnight is the beginning of the new day, and is represented by 0000, while 2400 represents midnight at the end of the day and is equivalent to 0000 of the following day. 1200 represents noon. Times between 0000-1159 are before noon, and times between 1201-2400 are after noon.  "

This is in contrast to weight, which varies from place to place depending on the gravitational field strength.    Conservation of Mass  The principle of the conservation of mass states that in a closed system, the total mass remains constant over time, regardless of the processes occurring within the system.    Inertia  Mass is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its motion. The greater the mass, the more force is required to change its state of motion (i.e., to accelerate it). This relation is expressed by Newton's Second law of motion: .    Gravitational Attraction  Mass is the source of gravitational attraction. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the force of attraction between two masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. where is the gravitational force acting between two objects, and are the masses of the objects, is the distance between the object, and is the universal gravitational constant.    Equivalence of Mass and Energy  According to Einstein's theory of relativity, mass and energy are equivalent and can be converted into each other. This is expressed in Einestein's famous equation .

  "body": " Force  What is force? In simple terms, a force is a push or a pull.  More precisely, a force is a vector quantity which tends to produce an acceleration of a body in the direction of its application. This means that if you want a stationary object to move, you must apply a force to it to get it going. If you want to keep it moving, you need to continuously apply a force to it to overcome friction, which is itself a force. Forces can exist without motion too – when an object is stationary it’s usually because there are many forces acting on it which cancel each other out, leaving no net force acting on the object. Forces always occur in pairs. A push on an object is always accompanied by an equal and opposite force acting on the pusher.  In the English system of units, force is measured in pounds, tons, or long tons.  In the SI system, force is measured in newtons ( ) or kilonewtons ( ). The newton is a derived unit, equal to the product of mass and acceleration.   For estimation purposes, a newton is about a quarter of a pound.  "

  "title": "Mass vs. Weight",
  "body": " Mass vs. Weight  One important force which we experience every day is weight . A common misconception is that mass and weight are the same. They are not: weight is a force , not a mass .   Weight vs. Mass    Weight is the force of gravity - the attraction between an object and the earth. The force exerted on an object is proportional to the mass of the object according to Newton’s second law, which states: , where is weight, is mass, and is the local acceleration due to gravity. Note that the weight of an object depends on both its mass and the acceleration of gravity acting on it.  The value of g depends on where you are: on earth the constant is greater than it is on the moon, so you weigh less on the moon than you do on earth. In outer space, the constant is zero, making you weightless there. The mass of an object will not change when it moves to another location, but its weight may. For example, on the earth's surface, a one kilogram mass weighs about 2.2 pounds, but on Mars, the same mass would weigh only about 0.8 pounds, and on Jupiter it would weigh roughly 5.5 pounds.  One reason why people often confuse weight with mass is because in the English system and on the surface of the earth, the gravitational constant g is equal to 1, and so one pound of mass has a weight of one pound of force. Move to the moon, and the pound of mass now weighs about six tenths of a pound. On earth in the SI system, . Note the units of . This is a metric quantity; appropriate unit conversions must be made when working with US units. See the following examples.   Weight 1   What is the mass in kg of an object that weighs 150 N on Earth?    The object has a calculated mass of 15.3 kg.    The problem supplies the weight and its location, Earth, which has a gravitational acceleration of .  Solving for mass and substituting gives:   Note that we used the conversion .     Weight 2   What is the mass of in kg an object that weighs on Earth?    The object has a calculated mass of 79.4 kg.    Since the weight is given in pounds-force, first convert it to newtons and then proceed as in the previous example.        A person who weighs 175 pounds on a scale, experiences a force of approximately 778.4 Newtons, has a calculated mass of 79.4 kilograms.    "

  "body": " Magnitude and Direction  The magnitude of a torque describes how strongly it turns an object, in the same way that the magnitude of a force describes how hard it pushes on something. When you turn a door knob, the magnitude is how hard you twist the knob. When you push on a door, the magnitude is the product of how hard you push and the distance from the hinges.  Torque is produced by applying a force at some distance from center of rotation. The magnitude is found by multiplying the applied force by the distance between the force and the axis of rotation measured perpendicularly. The perpendicular distance between the force and the axis of rotation is called the moment arm , or the lever arm . Note that if the moment arm is largest when the force is at a right angle with the shank of the wrench.     Since the torque is the product of the force’s magnitude and the perpendicular distance, the greater the force, the greater the torque, but the closer force is to the axis of rotation, the smaller the moment.

  "body": " Types of Torque   Static Torque is required to initiate movement from a standstill or to stop an already moving object. It is the torque required to overcome the inertia of a stationary object and start its rotation. Static torque also occurs when tightening or breaking loose a bolt.  Correct torque is crucial for bolted flanges to ensure a secure and leak-free connection. Applying the proper torque to the bolts on a flange ensures that the gasket is properly compressed, which prevents leaks and maintains the integrity of the joint. Torque is related to bolt tightness, but many additional factors, such as friction, can have a significant impact on the relationship of torque to the tightness of the bolted joint.   Static Torque: Turning a bolt     Dynamic Torque refers to the twisting force that maintains an object’s constant rotational motion once it has started moving. This type of torque is used to accelerate or decelerate a moving object, such as a wheel or a motor. It’s the torque necessary to keep an object spinning at a steady rate, overcoming any frictional forces acting against it. Dynamic Torque is often used in the context of continually operating systems, like turbines in a power plant or motors in electric appliances.  "

For example, one foot-pound of torque is equal to a force of one pound applied at a distance of one foot from the axis of rotation.  In the metric system, torque is measured in newton-meters (N-m) or in some cases, newton-centimeters (N-cm).

  "body": " Torque Measurement  Several tools are available for measuring torque. Some which you may encounter are:   Torque Wrench  A torque wrench is a precision tool commonly used to apply a specific amount of torque to fasteners such as nuts and bolts. A torque wrench has a calibrated scale or a digital display that allows the user to set and control the applied torque accurately.   Torque Wrench    Torque wrenches are used to apply precise amounts of torque to fasteners, ensuring they are neither too loose nor too tight. Over-tightening can strip threads or break fasteners, while under-tightening can lead to parts coming loose or failing to function properly. Manufacturers specify torque requirements for their products, and adhering to these specifications is often necessary to prevent damage and maintain warranties.    Torque Sensors   Torque Transducers , also commonly known as torque sensors ,  torque cells , or, torque gauges are devices that measure the torque applied to a stationary object or produced by a rotating system. These devices convert a torque measurement (reaction, dynamic or rotary) into an electrical signal that can be integrated into control systems or used as standalone devices to provide real-time torque measurements.   Rotary torque transducers measure the torque on rotating parts such as motors, crankshafts, and gearboxes.   Static torque transducers measure reaction torque without requiring the shaft to rotate. They are used where the torque of stationary objects needs to be measured.   Rotary and Static Torque Transducers         Dynamometers  A Prony brake is a friction brake and torque-measuring system that was invented by French mathematician and engineer Gaspard de Prony in 1821. The term \"brake horsepower\" is one measurement of power derived from this method of measuring torque. (Power is calculated by multiplying torque by rotational speed.) It is also known as an absorption dynamometer.   Prony Brake Dynamometer     "

Recall that the length of a lever can increase or decrease the force on an object at the expense of the distance through which the lever must be pushed. Similarly, the torque produced by a motor can be increased or decreased through the use of gearing. An increase in torque comes with a proportional decrease in rotational speed. The meshing of two gear teeth can be viewed as equivalent to the interaction of a pair of levers as shown in .  When a larger gear drives a smaller one, for one rotation of the larger gear the small gear must complete more revolutions - so the output will be faster than the input. If the situation is reversed, and a smaller gear drives a larger output gear, then for one rotation of the input the output will complete less than one revolution – so the output will be slower than the input. The ratio of the sizes of the two gears is proportional to the speed and torque changes between them.   Gear Ratios    "

Imagine looking at a car's speedometer at a specific instant; the reading is the car's instantaneous speed.   Average Speed the instantaneous speed averaged over a period of time. Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken to travel that distance.    Rotational Speed refers to how fast an object rotates or spins. It is often measured in revolutions per minute (RPM) or radians per second.    A knot is a unit used to describe the speed of ships.

In space, where there is no atmosphere the atmospheric pressure is zero, and this condition is known as a perfect vacuum .   Atmospheric Pressure    At sea level the average atmospheric pressure is sufficient to support a column of mercury (Hg) 760.0 millimeters or 29.92 inches, equivalent to approximately 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa. At higher elevations, the atmospheric pressure is less than at sea level. The bar is a unit of pressure equal to 100 kPa, which is just slightly less that 1 atmosphere.  The device used to measure the pressure of the atmosphere is called a barometer , so the absolute pressure of the atmosphere is also known as the barometric pressure. When you hear a weather report, this is the value reported.  The barometric pressure changes with weather conditions, but for most purposes aboard ship, this fact can be ignored, and we can assume that the atmospheric pressure is 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) or 760 mm Hg. at all times.

By common convention, when pressure is given in psi, pounds per square foot, or similar units, gage pressure is assumed. The g (for gage) is added only when there is some possibility of confusion. Absolute pressure, on the other hand, is always expressed as pounds per square inch absolute (psia), pounds per square foot absolute (psfa), and so forth.

  "body": " Vacuum   A pressure below atmospheric pressure is called a vacuum . The farther below the atmospheric pressure, the greater the vacuum. Vacuum cannot be increased without limit, however. At some point, the pressure drops as low as possible and a perfect vacuum is achieved. A perfect vacuum is the lowest possible pressure, or the absence of all pressure. When we speak of a high vacuum, we are talking about a low absolute pressure.   Pressure Scales     When measuring a vacuum, there are three possible methods.  When vacuum is measured starting with zero at perfect vacuum and increasing as pressure rises, then the greater the value, the smaller the vacuum. This is simply the absolute pressure scale.  We can also measure pressure on a scale starting at zero at atmospheric pressure, and indicating negative values when the pressure is below atmospheric pressure. This is gage pressure scale, and what happens when a vacuum is applied to a standard pressure gage.  And finally, we can measure vacuum on a scale starting with zero at atmospheric pressure and increasing as the vacuum increases. On this scale no vacuum would be indicated by 0 psig, and a perfect vacuum would be indicated by approximately 14.7 psi vacuum. This is called the vacuum scale, this is the gage pressure with the negative sign removed.      Vacuum Gages use the third method. Vacuum scales range from zero to thirty inches of mercury. When a vacuum gage reads zero, the pressure measured is 0 psig = atmospheric pressure, or in other words, no vacuum. A reading of 29.92 inches of mercury would indicate a perfect (or nearly perfect) vacuum. In actual practice, it is impossible to obtain a perfect vacuum even under laboratory conditions.

  "body": " Head  You will also find another kind of pressure unit, which appears to be a length. These units include inches of water, inches of mercury (Hg), or the height of some other liquid of known density. These units, while measured in length units, still represent a pressure. The length describes the pressure exerted by a column of liquid of the given height, and is known as the head .  For example, a pressure reading of 1 inch of water (1 in. H₂O) means that the exerted pressure is equal to the pressure exerted by a column of water 1 inch high, or that a column of water in a U-tube would be displaced 1 inch by the pressure being measured. Similarly, a reading of 12 inches of mercury (12 in. Hg) means that the measured pressure is sufficient to support a column of mercury 12 inches high.  What is really being expressed, even though it is not mentioned in the pressure unit, is the fact that a certain quantity of material (water, mercury, etc.) of known density will exert a certain definite force upon a specified area. Pressure is still force per unit area even if the pressure unit refers to the height of some liquid.   Head Calculations  Fresh water has a specific weight . This means that a cube of water weighs . To find the pressure of a column of water 1 foot high, divide the weight of the water by the by the area of the of the base of the cube.    One cubic foot of fresh water weighs 62.4 pounds.    This equation indicates that a 1 foot head of fresh water exerts a pressure at the base.  Each additional foot of head will increase the pressure by an additional , so a head (of water, in feet) is equivalent to a pressure   For liquids other than fresh water, the calculation must be adjusted for density. Recall that the specific gravity of a substance is defined as the ratio of the density (or specific weight) of a substance to the same value for water . Fresh water has a specific gravity of 1; salt water has a specific gravity of 1.031, so it is slightly denser than fresh water; and mercury has a specific gravity of 13.633, so it is much denser than water.  To find the pressure in psi of a head of a fluid with a specific gravity s.g.      What head of water will cause a pressure of ?

  "body": " Barometer     A barometer is an instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure. There are two basic types of barometers:  The mercury barometer , which was invented by Evangelista Torricelli in 1643, consists of a glass tube, closed at one end and filled with mercury. The open end of the tube is placed in a reservoir of mercury. Atmospheric pressure pushes down on the surface of the mercury in the reservoir, causing the mercury in the tube to rise or fall. The height of the mercury column in the tube, usually measured in millimeters or inches, indicates the atmospheric pressure. Mercury is used in barometers because its high density means the height of the column can be a reasonable size to measure atmospheric pressure. A barometer using water, for instance, would need to be about 34 feet tall, while a mercury barometer less than three feet tall..  The aneroid barometer contains a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid chamber, which is tightly sealed and partially evacuated of air. Changes in atmospheric pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. This movement drives levers and springs that move a needle on a dial to indicate the pressure reading. Aneroid barometers are more portable and durable than mercury barometers.   Mercury Barometer and Aneroid Barometers        "

Unlike a barometer, which measures atmospheric pressure, a manometer is used to measure the pressure above or below atmospheric, or the pressure difference between two points.  The manometer consists of a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, usually mercury or water.  When the pressures on both sides of the manometer are equal, the fluid levels will equalize, but if two different pressures are applied , the levels will adjust until the pressures are balanced by the weight of liquid in the higher leg. The height difference ( ) between the twp surfaces corresponds to the pressure difference.  When one leg is open to the atmosphere, the pressure difference represents a gauge pressure.   U-tube manometer    For a U-tube manometer the pressure difference is calculated using the formula: where is the density of the liquid in the manometer, is the acceleration due to gravity, and is the height difference between the liquid columns.

  "title": "Bourdon Tube Gauges",
  "body": " Bourdon Tube Gauges   A Bourdon tube pressure gauge is a mechanical device used for measuring pressure.  The key element is the Bourdon tube, a C-shaped tube typically made of metal such as brass, bronze, or stainless steel. A Bourdon tube gauge relies on the elasticity and mechanical properties of the Bourdon tube to sense pressure. When pressure is applied, the tube straightens or uncoils slightly. This deformation is transmitted through a linkage and gear to a pointer, which moves across the calibrated dial to indicate the pressure.   Bourdon Tube Pressure Gauge    Bourdon tube gauges are simple, robust, and they require no external power. They are durable, capable of withstanding harsh environments and high pressures, and provide reasonably accurate readings for many industrial applications. However, there are some limitations. Bourdon tube gauges can be sensitive to extreme temperatures, which may affect their accuracy. Over time, the moving parts may wear out, necessitating maintenance or replacement. Additionally, they are not suitable for very low or very high-pressure measurements beyond their design specifications.  All bourdon tube gauges measure gage pressure , that the indicator points to zero when they are connected to atmospheric pressure. All other measurements are relative to this zero value.    Types of Bourdon Tube Gauges  Several types of Bourdon tube gauges are available for different applications. Scales marked using various units are also available.   Simplex Gauge : This is a basic bourdon tube gauge, designed to measure positive pressures only. The scale starts at atmospheric pressure on the left and rotates clockwise as the measured pressure increases. A peg on the face prevents the pointer from moving below 0. The gauge is a dual-scale model, with pressure indicated in both psig and kPa.   Simplex Pressure Gauge     Vacuum gauge : Vacuum gages are designed to measure pressures below atmospheric only. The scale starts at zero on the right and rotates counterclockwise as the absolute pressure decreases and the vacuum increases. The maximum values on the gauge corresponds to the maximum possible vacuum that can be achieved relative to the atmospheric pressure, approximately 30 inches or 760 mm of mercury vacuum. Note that the gauge below has dual scales: inches of mercury vacuum and mm mercury absolute.   Vacuum Gauge     Compound Gauge : These gauges can measure both positive and negative (vacuum) pressures, making them suitable for applications where both types of pressure need to be monitored. There is no distinct zero point on these gauges because it moves as the atmospheric pressure changes. The pressure and vacuum scales are usually marked with different units. On the gauge shown, positive pressures are in psi or bar, and vacuums are in inches mercury, and bars absolute.   Compound Pressure Gauge     Differential Gauge : This gauge is designed to measure the pressure difference between points. Internally, there are two bourdon tubes, and the linkage is arranged to move the pointer based on the difference between them. These gauges are recognizable because they have two pressure connections, but only one pointer. Differential gauges are often used to measure the pressure drop across filters or strainers. An increasing pressure drop is an indication that the strainer needs to be cleaned or the filter changed.   Differential Pressure Gauge     Duplex Gauge : This type features two separate bourdon tubes and pointers within a single gauge housing, allowing simultaneous measurement of two different pressures. Useful for displaying two different but related pressures simultaneously, for example the inlet and outlet pressures on a heat exchanger.   Duplex Pressure Gauge      Gage Calibration   Gage calibration involves comparing a gauge's readings against a known standard or reference to ensure accuracy and correct any discrepancies. Gages are initially calibrated at the factory, but they should also be recalibrated at regular intervals. Recalibration helps to detect and correct drift, wear, or damage in the gauge, thus ensuring reliable performance. The frequency of recalibration depends on factors such as the gauge’s usage, the criticality of the measurements, and manufacturer recommendations.  Two adjustments are usually made when performing a calibration.   Zero Adjustment : This is typically done first. The gauge is checked at no pressure, and adjustments are made to set the pointer at zero. This ensures that the gauge has no offset error.   Span Adjustment : After setting the zero point, the gauge is subjected to its maximum rated pressure to check the upper end of the scale. Adjustments are then made to ensure that the gauge reads accurately at this high-pressure point. This process might also include intermediate points to verify linearity across the span.   "

  "body": " Temperature Scales  The most commonly used temperature scale in the US today is the Fahrenheit scale, abbreviated F. In this scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. (This only holds strictly when atmospheric pressure equals the average sea level pressure. At high altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature, as anyone who cooks in the mountains knows.)  Another common scale is the Celsius scale. In this scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees.  There are also temperature scales in which zero is absolute zero , the lowest possible temperature. (People have gotten close to absolute zero, but have never reached it. According to theory, we never will.) Absolute zero is at -273.15 Celsius, or -459.67 Fahrenheit.  The Kelvin temperature scale uses the same size degree as Celsius, but has its zero set to absolute zero.  The Rankine temperature scale uses the same size degree as Fahrenheit, but has its zero set to absolute zero  The Celsius and Kelvin scales are part of the International System of Units (SI), providing a standardized and widely adopted system for expressing temperatures. Celsius is the more common scale for everyday use, while Kelvin is often used in scientific and thermodynamic calculations.   Temperature Scales    "

  "title": "Temperature Measuring Instruments",
  "body": " Temperature Measuring Instruments  Various instruments are used to measure temperature in different applications. The choice of temperature measurement instrument depends on factors such as the required accuracy, temperature range, and the specific application or industry. Different instruments are suitable for different temperature ranges and environments.  Here are some common instruments used to measure temperature:   Liquid in Glass Thermometers are the most common instruments for measuring temperature. The basic principle involves the expansion or contraction of a temperature-sensitive substance in response to temperature changes. This type of thermometer consists of a liquid (usually mercury or colored alcohol ) sealed in a glass tube. The liquid expands or contracts with temperature changes, and the temperature is read from a scale etched on the thermometer.   Liquid in Glass Thermometer     Bimetallic temperature sensors use the differential expansion of two metals to detect temperature changes. These are often used in thermostats and mechanical temperature gauges.   Bimetallic Temperature Sensor    A thermocouple is a device which measures temperature using the Seebeck effect . In 1821, Thomas Seebeck discovered that a voltage will be generated in a wire loop made from two dissimilar conductors when two junctions are maintained at different temperatures. The Seebeck effect is used to measure temperature with great sensitivity and accuracy .  A thermocouple consists of two metal wires made of different materials, joined at one end to form a junction. The junction, called the hot junction , is placed where the high temperature is to be determined, while the other ends, called the cold junction , are maintained at a lower, stable temperature. The voltage difference between the wires at the cold junction is used to determine the temperature at the hot junction.  Thermocouples are designated by letters and colors indicating the specific pairs of metals used. The most common thermocouple types are J (black), K (yellow) and T (blue). The choice of a thermocouple is based on the required temperature range and accuracy.   Thermocouple    A Resistance Temperature Detector or RTD is a device that determines the temperature of an object by measuring the electrical resistance of a sensing element, The sensors resistance changes linearly as a function of temperature, increasing as the temperature rises and decreasing when the sensor cools.  Most RTDs are either wire wound or thin film types Wire wound RTDs use a fine platinum wire wrapped around a glass or ceramic core, while thin film RTDs use a base ceramic element with a platinum track deposited on it. In either case, the sensing element normally housed in a protective probe to protect them from the environment they are immersed in and to make them more robust.  While thermocouples and RTDs both measure temperature, there are several differences between the two methods, such as:  Thermocouples are usually smaller than RTDs, making them easier to use.  Thermocouples (-200 to 2000°C) offer a wider range of temperature operation than RTDs (-200 to 600° C). This means that thermocouples are suitable for more applications.  Thermocouples offer a response time between 0.1 and 10s which is faster than the response time of RTD sensors.  RTDs can self-heat while this issue is negligible with the thermocouples.  Thermocouplesare more sensitive than RTD temperature sensors. This is so because these react faster than RTDs with the variation in temperature.  For thermocouples, the graph between resistance and temperature is not linear, while an RTD is linear.     Resistance Temperature Device RTD    A Thermistor is a type of temperature-sensitive resistor whose electrical resistance changes significantly with temperature. It is commonly used in electronic devices and temperature control systems.   Thermistor    An Infrared (IR) thermometer measures temperature without direct contact with the object. It detects the infrared radiation emitted by the object, and converts it into a temperature reading.  IR thermometers are used for non-contact measurements, remote measurement, or in hazardous environments.   Infrared Thermometer    "

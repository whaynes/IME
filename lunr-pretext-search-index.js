  "body": " Slips, Trips and Falls  According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, slips, trips, and falls cause nearly 700 fatalities per year and many more injurious accidents in the workplace,  Common trip and fall hazards include obstructions on walkways, such as cables, tools, or equipment left in pathways. Uneven surfaces, loose gratings, and obstructions, can also contribute to tripping incidents. Additionally, poor lighting, cluttered work areas, improper storage of materials, and inadequate lighting can increase the risk of trips and falls.  Spilled liquids, oils, or water can make surfaces extremely slippery. Wet surfaces due to cleaning or maintenance activities, and the presence of loose debris are additional factors that can contribute to slip incidents.  Falls can be particularly dangerous when you are working at above the ground, such as on a ladder, scaffolding or staging.  Aboard ship, additional hazards exist due to the dynamic and often wet environment. Obstructions such as hatch combings, pad-eyes and container hold-downs can cause individuals to trip. Slip hazards arise from seawater or rainwater on deck surfaces, spilled liquids in galley areas, or lubricants used for machinery maintenance. In rough seas, the motion of the ship can cause unsecured objects to fall, or cause you to lose your balance and fall. You must be particularly careful when working at heights or over the side. Always follow the old adage, “one hand for the ship and one hand for yourself.  "

  "title": "Electrical Hazards",
  "body": " Electrical Hazards  Electricity is a powerful and essential source of energy, but it can cause severe injuries, fires, and even fatalities if not handled properly. Understanding the hazards posed by electricity is crucial for practicing electrical safety.   Danger High Voltage    Here are some of the main hazards associated with electricity:   Electrical Shock  The most immediate and dangerous hazard of electricity is electrical shock. When a person comes into contact with an electrical voltage, current can pass through their body, causing electrical shock.  Roughly speaking, the greater the current, the more severe the shock. High voltage presents more danger than lower voltages, but even normal household voltage (120 V AC) can cause severe shock or even death.    Electrical Fires  Electrical malfunctions can generate heat and sparks, leading to electrical fires. Faulty wiring, overloaded circuits, damaged electrical cords, and short circuits are common causes of electrical fires. These fires can quickly spread and pose a significant risk to property and life. The combination of electricity and flammable materials increases the likelihood of a fire and makes it more challenging to extinguish.    Arc Flash and Arc Blast   Arc flash refers to the release of intense heat, light, and energy that occurs during an electrical fault or short circuit. It is characterized by a sudden and violent discharge of electrical energy through the air. The arc flash generates extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit (19,400 degrees Celsius). The intense heat emitted during an arc flash can cause severe burns to anyone in its vicinity. Additionally, the arc flash produces a bright flash of light, which can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment.   Arc blast , on the other hand, refers to the high-pressure shockwave produced by the rapid expansion of air during an arc flash. The rapid expansion of these vapors creates a blast wave that can cause significant physical damage. Arc blasts can result in powerful pressure waves, similar to those generated by an explosion, which can cause injuries, such as concussions, fractures, hearing loss, and even fatalities. The arc blast can propel debris, molten metal, and hot gases, further exacerbating the risk to individuals in the vicinity.    Electrical Burns  Electrical burns occur when electric current passes through the body, generating heat. These burns can be internal or external, depending on the path the electricity takes. Electrical burns can cause extensive tissue damage and may require specialized medical treatment. The severity of electrical burns depends on the voltage, current, duration of contact, and the body's resistance.    Electrocution  In the most severe cases, electric shocks can lead to electrocution, resulting in death. High-voltage shocks can cause cardiac arrest, severe internal injuries, and other life-threatening conditions. Contact with overhead power lines, unauthorized access to electrical panels or equipment, and improper handling of live wires are some situations that can lead to fatal accidents.    Effects of Electrical Current on the Human Body  Electrical shock occurs when current passes through the body. The severity of the shock depends on the current’s magnitude, the duration, the contact area, and the path taken by the current through the body.  The shock current received obeys Ohm’s law , so high voltages are always more dangerous. But your body resistance is equally important. Body resistance with dry skin may be above 100,000 ohms, However, if the skin is wet or broken, the body's resistance decreases to a few thousand ohms.      Current  Reaction 1 Second contact    < 1 mA   Generally not perceptible.     1 mA   Threshold of feeling, tingling sensation.     3 mA   Painful shock. Average individual can let go.     5 mA   Accepted as maximum harmless current. Strong involuntary reactions may cause indirect accidents.     6 25 mA   Beginning of sustained muscular contraction. (\"Can't let go\" current.)     9 30 mA   Lung paralysis, Respiratory arrest ‐ usually temporary, but death is possible.     50 mA   Possible ventricular fibrillation. (heart dysfunction, usually fatal.)     100 300 mA   Certain ventricular fibrillation, fatal.     1 4 Amps   Heart paralysis, severe burns. Muscular contraction and nerve damage occur; death is likely.     5 Amps   Flesh burns, defibrillation, temporary respiratory paralysis.      "

  "body": " Chemical Hazards  Chemicals can pose significant risks to human health and safety. By identifying and understanding the potential hazards, following proper storage and handling procedures, and adhering to safety protocols, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with hazardous chemicals and create a safer environment for everyone.   Hazardous Material Placards     Chemical Exposure  You may be exposed to hazardous chemicals through inhalation, skin contact, or ingestion. Prolonged exposure or exposure to high concentrations can lead to adverse health effects such as respiratory issues, skin irritation, chemical burns, organ damage, or even long-term illnesses.  You should be aware of the hazardous chemicals present in your workplace, handle them safely and take precautions to minimize exposure, such as using proper ventilation systems, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), and following established protocols.  You can learn about the potential risks associated with a chemical, as well as instructions on how to handle and respond to accidents or exposures, in the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), which is required to be available in your workplace. MSDSs are typically created by the manufacturer or supplier of the chemical and are designed to ensure the safe use, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances.    Chemical Storage  Chemicals that are improperly stored or incompatible substances stored in close proximity can react with one another, causing fires, explosions, or the release of toxic gases. Inadequate storage practices may also result in spills, leaks, or contamination, endangering both employees and the environment.  It is essential to follow proper storage procedures, including segregating incompatible chemicals, labeling containers correctly, ensuring proper ventilation and temperature control, and implementing appropriate containment measures such as spill kits and secondary containment systems. The MSDS will contain instructions regarding proper storage.  In particular, aboard ship chemical containers must always be secured so that they don’t break free and cause accidents during heavy weather.    Handling and Transporation  Improper handling of hazardous chemicals, such as careless pouring, transferring chemicals without suitable protective measures, or failure to follow established protocols, can result in spills, splashes, or exposure.

  "body": " Fire  Fire aboard ship is an ever-present threat that can swiftly escalate into a catastrophic disaster. With limited means of escape, a ship becomes a confined space where flames can spread rapidly, fueled by combustible materials and confined by its structure.  The close quarters, complex layout, and intricate ventilation systems aboard ship create formidable challenges for the ship’s small firefighting team. In addition to the immediate threat to human lives, a shipboard fire poses a significant risk to the environment, as toxic smoke, potential oil spills, and the release of hazardous substances can wreak havoc on marine ecosystems.    Hyundai Fortune on fire 21 March 2006    Effective fire prevention measures, comprehensive emergency response plans, rigorous training, and state-of-the-art firefighting equipment are crucial in mitigating this threat and ensuring the safety of everyone on board.  Fire prevention measures play a vital role in minimizing the risk of fire and maintaining a safe environment aboard ship. These measures encompass a range of proactive strategies aimed at preventing fires from starting or spreading. One fundamental aspect is implementing rigorous safety protocols and adhering to international standards, such as the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) regulations for fire safety.  Some key fire prevention measures include:    Regular Inspections and Maintenance. Conducting routine inspections of electrical systems, machinery, and fire suppression equipment is crucial. Identifying and addressing potential hazards, faulty wiring, or malfunctioning equipment can prevent fire incidents.     Training and Education. Crew members should receive comprehensive training on fire safety, including proper handling of flammable substances, effective use of firefighting equipment, and emergency response procedures. Increasing awareness and knowledge among the crew can significantly reduce the likelihood of fire-related accidents.     Fire Detection Systems. Installing advanced fire detection systems, such as smoke detectors, heat sensors, and flame detectors, helps in early detection of fires. These systems can trigger alarms, alerting the crew and initiating immediate response actions.     Fire Suppression Systems. Equipping ships with reliable fire suppression systems, such as fixed CO2 or water mist systems, can effectively control and extinguish fires.

The primary cause of fatigue is insufficient or poor-quality sleep. To avoid fatigue, it's important to prioritize adequate rest and sleep, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Other factor which can contribute to fatigue include: medical conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, anemia, and thyroid disorders; depression and anxiety, and unhealthy lifestyle habits, including inadequate physical activity, poor nutrition, excessive caffeine or alcohol intake, and smoking. Certain medications have fatigue as a side effect.  The negative consequences of fatigue include:  Fatigue can significantly impair cognitive abilities, including attention, concentration, memory, and decision-making. This can lead to reduced performance and increased errors, particularly in tasks that require sustained focus or critical thinking, such as driving, operating machinery, or performing complex work.  Fatigue can slow down reaction times and impair alertness, making it more challenging to respond quickly and appropriately to stimuli or unexpected events. This can increase the risk of accidents, both in occupational settings and during activities like driving or operating heavy equipment.  Fatigue-related impairment can lead to an increased risk of accidents and injuries across various domains, including workplaces, roadways, and other high-risk environments. Fatigue-related accidents have been linked to major incidents in industries such as transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing.  Fatigue can impair an individual's ability to assess risks accurately and make sound judgments. This can result in poor decision-making, potentially leading to safety hazards or negative consequences in various aspects of life, including personal relationships and professional responsibilities.  The IMO has developed guidelines for rest requirements to address the issue of fatigue among seafarers. These guidelines are outlined in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention).  The STCW Convention sets out minimum hours of rest for seafarers. The standard requires that seafarers receive a minimum of 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period and a minimum of 77 hours of rest in any 7-day period. The hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, with one period being at least 6 hours in length.  In situations where the safety of the ship, crew, or passengers is compromised, and in cases of emergencies or drills, the rest period may be temporarily shortened or interrupted. However, the seafarers should be provided with compensatory rest as soon as possible.  "

  "title": "Confined Spaces",
  "body": " Confined Spaces     Working in enclosed spaces   Precautions to be taken prior to entering enclosed spaces    A confined space is defined by OSHA as a space that has limited or restricted means of entry, is not designed for continuous occupancy, and is large enough and configured so that a person can enter the space and maneuver well enough to perform tasks.  Confined spaces pose several hazards that can endanger workers who enter them due to their limited entry and exit points, restricted airflow, and potential for hazardous atmospheres.  On ships, some examples of confined spaces include: Cargo and fuel tanks, cofferdams, pressure vessels, sewage tanks, and void spaces.   Confined Space Hazards    Here are some hazards associated with confined spaces:   Lack of oxygen  Confined spaces often have limited ventilation, which can lead to a decrease in oxygen levels. This oxygen-deficient atmosphere can cause dizziness, loss of consciousness, or even asphyxiation.    Toxic gases and vapors  Confined spaces may contain hazardous gases or vapors, such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, or volatile chemicals. These substances can accumulate in the confined space and pose a serious health risk to individuals who inhale them, leading to poisoning or respiratory problems.    Fire and explosion risks  Confined spaces may contain flammable substances, inadequate electrical systems, or potential ignition sources. This combination can result in the rapid escalation of fire or explosion hazards, especially in spaces with limited airflow and potential fuel accumulation.    Engulfment or entrapment  Confined spaces often have small openings or tight access points. If an individual becomes trapped or engulfed by materials, such as loose soil, water, or flowing grain, it can lead to serious injury, suffocation, or drowning.    Physical hazards  Confined spaces may have uneven surfaces, protruding objects, or low ceilings, increasing the risk of slips, trips, falls, and head injuries. Limited visibility and restricted movement within the space can further contribute to accidents and make rescue difficult.    Extreme temperatures  Some confined spaces can experience extreme temperatures due to insulation issues, lack of ventilation, or the presence of heat-generating equipment. Excessive heat or cold can cause thermal discomfort, heat exhaustion, hypothermia, or heat stroke.  Emergency repairs to boilers must sometimes be made before the boiler has had a chance to cool down.    Biological hazards  In certain confined spaces, such as sewage tanks or areas with stagnant water, there may be an increased risk of exposure to bacteria, viruses, or mold, which can lead to respiratory issues, allergies, or infectious diseases.   For safe entry into a confined space, everyone involved should be properly trained on confined space entry and rescue techniques and strictly comply with all regulations and guidelines governing confined space entry.  Begin by conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify potential hazards and establish necessary control measures. Inspect the equipment used for entry to guarantee its reliability.  Ensure proper ventilation is in place, to maintain fresh air and remove hazardous substances. Test the atmosphere using gas detection equipment before entering to verify safe conditions. Wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protection and fall protection gear.  Maintain proper lighting to ensure visibility within the confined space. Establish effective communication systems between individuals inside and outside the space. Designate a standby person outside the space, equipped with rescue training, to provide immediate assistance if required.  "

  "body": " Job Hazard Analysis  A job hazard analysis (JHA), also known as a job safety analysis (JSA), is a systematic process used to identify and analyze potential hazards or risks associated with specific job tasks or activities. Its primary purpose is to reduce the risk of accidents by identifying potential hazards and developing appropriate controls to mitigate them.  The process typically involves breaking down a job into its individual steps and examining each step to identify potential hazards. Hazards can include physical hazards (e.g., machinery, equipment, or environmental conditions), chemical hazards (e.g., exposure to hazardous substances), biological hazards (e.g., exposure to infectious agents), ergonomic hazards (e.g., repetitive motion or lifting heavy objects), or any other factors that could pose a risk to worker safety and health.  The key steps in conducting a job hazard analysis typically include:  Select the job or task to be analyzed.  Break down the job into steps.  Identify potential hazards for each step.   Determine the risk level for each identified hazard. Risk level multiplies severity and the likelihood of each identified hazard.   Develop hazard controls to eliminate or minimize the hazards. This might include engineering controls (e.g., machine guarding), administrative controls (e.g., training or procedures), or personal protective equipment (PPE)  Communicate the findings to workers and stakeholders to ensure awareness and buy-in.  Regularly review and update the job hazard analysis.    This results of the JHA can be shared with the crew during a toolbox talk in order to raise awareness about known hazards, reinforce safe work practices, and promote a culture of safety. These talks are usually conducted before the start of the work day.  Systematically analyzing and communicating job hazards and implementing appropriate controls helps to create a safer workplace.

Make sure your PPE is in good condition and fits properly.    Maintain Cleanliness and Organization  Keep your work area clean, organized, and free of clutter. Properly stow tools and equipment after use to prevent trip hazards. Promptly clean up any spills or debris to maintain a safe working environment.    Practice Safe Lifting Techniques  To lift heavy objects safely, follow these guidelines:  Assess the object's weight and plan your lift accordingly. Warm up your muscles with light exercises. Stand close to the object with feet shoulder-width apart, keeping your back straight and bending at the knees. Get a firm grip on the object and lift using the strength of your legs, not your back. Avoid twisting and keep the object close to your body.  Don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Prioritize safety and listen to your body to prevent injuries.    Maintain Personal Fitness and Well-being  Ensure you are physically and mentally fit for the tasks assigned to you. Get enough rest, eat well, and stay hydrated. Fatigue and exhaustion can compromise your alertness and increase the risk of accidents. Don’t abuse alcohol or drugs, and certainly don’t attempt to perform your duties when you’re impaired.    Follow Emergency Procedures  Familiarize yourself with the ship's emergency procedures, including evacuation routes, muster stations, and the proper use of life-saving equipment. Be prepared to respond calmly and promptly in case of an emergency.    Practice Good Communication  Safety is a team effort. Maintain open and effective communication with your fellow crew members. Share safety-related information, ask questions, and seek clarification when needed. Don’t hesitate to speak up if you notice safety hazards, near misses, or unsafe practices. Effective communication is essential for preventing, addressing and resolving safety issues promptly.    Learn Continuously  Stay proactive in expanding your safety knowledge and skills. Participate in safety training programs, attend safety briefings, and stay updated on safety regulations and best practices. Take safety drills seriously. The more informed you are, the better equipped you will be to protect yourself contribute to a safe working environment.     By following these safety practices, you will not only protect yourself but also contribute to the overall safety of the crew and the smooth operation of the ship. Remember, safety should always be your top priority.  "

  "body": " Head Protection  Introduction   Types of Head Protection  There are several types of hard hats available, each designed for specific purposes and levels of protection. Here are some common types of hard hats:   Class A. Class A hard hats and caps are intended for general service and they provide protection against impact hazards and a limited protection against electrical shock. They are used in industries such as construction, manufacturing, mining, and shipbuilding. This is the most suitable hard hat for shipboard use.   Class B. Class B hard hats are utility service hats which are designed to protect the wearer’s head from impact and penetration by falling or flying objects and from high-voltage shock and burns. They are used extensively by electrical workers.   Hard Hat     Class C. The safety hat or cap in Class C is designed specifically for lightweight comfort and impact protection and is sometimes known as a bump cap. Class C helmets are used on occasions where there is a possibility of bumping the head against a fixed object and no danger from falling objects or electrical shock. Bump caps can be worn for protection against scalp lacerations from contact with sharp objects. However, they are not substitutes for safety caps\/hats because they do not afford protection from high impact forces or penetration by falling objects.    Fit  Correct adjustment and fit of the your hard hat is required for maximum safety. The internal cradle of the headband and sweatband forms a suspension system which keeps the helmet away from the head and cushions against impact. The headband must be adjusted to the right size in order to provide sufficient clearance between the shell and the headband.  Before using a hard hat you should inspect it for signs of damage or abuse of the helmet or any of its parts. A damaged helmet reduces the margin of safety the hat was designed to supply, and should be replaced immediately.   "

  "body": " Eye Protection  Introduction   Types of Eye Protection  The three main types of eye protection for general maintenance are safety glasses, goggles, and face shields. In addition, when welding, specialized equipment must be used to protect your eyes. Each method of eye protection has its own advantages and disadvantages.   Safety Glasses. Safety glasses are lightweight glasses that have shatter resistant lenses made of materials like polycarbonate or propionate plastic and often have side shields attached to the side pieces. Safety glasses are designed to stop flying objects such as chips, fragments, sand, and dirt from injuring your eyes. They also can provide laser light filtration to prevent reflections from the laser entering the eye and causing retinal burns. Safety glasses can be purchased with prescription lenses including bifocals if necessary.  The main advantage of safety glasses is that they are lightweight and relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The provide little to no protection from liquids or vapors, and some flying particles may get around the side shields.   Types of Eye Protection     Goggles. Goggles provide more complete protection of the eye than safety glasses, since they protect against both frontal and side impact. They come in two different types, vented and non-vented. Vented goggles are used to protect your eyes from splashes and flying objects, while Non-vented Goggles additionally protect your eyes from hazardous vapors, mists, and fumes.   Face Shields. Face shields are designed to augment other types of eye protection and are not meant to be a stand alone form of eye protection. Face shields are used to protect your entire face with goggles on under the shield to catch any liquids that might make it past the shield.    Eye Protection for Welding  Always wear a welding helmet when arc welding. Your eyes, face, and neck need protection against the burning rays of the arc, and from the splatter of molten metal and slag. To protect your eyesight, make sure the welding helmet has a coloured lens with at least a No. 10 shade when welding with 200 amperes or less. And never strike a welding arc before your helmet is in place. Never look at an arc from any distance with your naked eyes while someone else is welding.  Never chip slag when your eyes (or those of others nearby) are not protected by goggles, an eye shield, or the clear lens of a welding helmet. If fragments of hot slag were to hit the eye, medical attention would be required for their removal, and blindness could result. The risk of permanent eye injury is so great that you should never chip slag from a weld without protecting your eyes.   "

  "body": " Hearing Protection  Introduction   Types of Hearing Protectors  There are various types of hearing protection available to safeguard against excessive noise levels. Here are some common types:   Types of Hearing Protection     Disposable foam plugs. Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each person’s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better.   Reusable, pre-molded plugs. Pre-molded plugs are made from silicone, plastic or rubber and are manufactured as either one-size-fits-most or are available in several sizes. Be sure to choose the proper size for your ear canals. In some cases, different size plugs may be required for each ear. The advantage of pre-molded plugs are that they are inexpensive, reusable, washable, convenient to carry, and come in a variety of sizes. Nearly everyone can find a plug that will be comfortable and effective. Another advantage is that in a dirty environment like the engine room, you don’t need to handle or roll the tips. You insert this type of plug by reaching over your head with one hand to pull up on your ear. Then use your other hand to insert the plug with a gentle rocking motion until you have sealed the ear canal.   Hearing Bands. Hearing Bands, also called canal caps or semi-insert devices often resemble earplugs on a flexible plastic or metal band. The earplug tips of a canal cap may be a formable or pre-molded material. Some have headbands that can be worn over the head, behind the neck or under the chin. The main advantage of canal caps is their convenience They are easy to put on and take off . When it’s quiet, employees can leave the band hanging around their necks, but they can quickly insert the plug tips when hazardous noise starts again. These devices are ideal for intermittent use, but they provide less protection then either plugs or muffs. Some people find the pressure from the bands uncomfortable.   What is a Decibel?  The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first let’s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power , and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power , but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by where the log is to base 10.  If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is . If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be B. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be . This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size.  Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, . The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of is just , this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with and is defined as: where the log is to base 10.  This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries. So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that dB where is the sound pressure of the reference level, and that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long.  What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level . So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals.    "

These units have filters, cartridges, or canisters that remove contaminants from the air by passing the air through the air-purifying element before it reaches the user. Air purifying respirators are further divided into:   Particulate Respirators , which capture particles such as dusts, paint fumes, and mists, but do not protect against gases and vapors. The filters in particulate respirators generally work better as particles accumulate on the filter. If the filter becomes so clogged that it is difficult to breathe, it should be replaced.   Gas and Vapor Respirators , which use a chemical cartridge or canister to remove dangerous gases or vapors, but which do not protect against airborne particles. These units only protect against specific gases or vapors, and only provide protection as long as the filter’s absorbing capacity remains.   Combination Respirators , which can be used in atmospheres that contain both hazardous gases and particles.     Atmosphere-supplying respirators     Atmosphere-supplying Respirators. These units supply clean air directly to the user from a source other than the air surrounding the user. The types of air-supplying respirators are:   Air Supplied Respirators , which have a hose which connects to a source of clean air under pressure. These units have no time limit on the air supply, but the hose limits the range and mobility of the user and is susceptible to damage.   Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus , which have a wearable clean-air supply pack. These units have better mobility than the air-supplied respirator, but the clean air time is limited to the capacity of the tank.   Combination Respirators , which are similar to the air-supplied respirators, but also have a small, self-contained air supply which can be used for escape if the primary supply fails.     "

Boots provide more protection than shoes from chemicals and molten metals splashes and spark hazards, but they are heavier. Some protective features that are available in both boots and shoes include:  Oil resistant shoes  Chemical resistant shoes  Heat resistant shoes  Slip and skid resistant shoes  Waterproof and water resistant shoes     Steel-Reinforced Safety Shoes and Boots Similar to safety shoes, these have the toe box and insole reinforced with steel, and the instep reinforced with steel, aluminum, or plastic. These shoes will protect your feet from falling objects and puncture injuries.   Composite-Toe Safety Shoes Composite-toe shoes have a protective cap made of non-metallic materials such as carbon fiber, Kevlar, or fiberglass. They offer lightweight protection and are ideal for environments where metal detection is required or in situations where electrical conductivity needs to be minimized.   Electrically Insulated Safety Shoes These shoes have non-conductive soles to prevent the wearer’s feet from completing an electrical circuit to ground. They can protect workers against as much as 600 volts in dry conditions. These shoes should be used in conjunction with insulated tools and precautions to reduce or eliminate the potential for providing a path for hazardous electrical energy. Non-conductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations; in such locations, electrically conductive shoes are required.   Electrically Conductive Safety Shoes These shoes protect against the buildup of static electricity. Essentially, these shoes ground the employees wearing them. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on an employee’s body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. During training, employees must be instructed not to use foot powder or wear socks made of silk, wool, or nylon with conductive shoes. Foot powder insulates and retards the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool, and nylon produce static electricity. Conductive shoes are not general-purpose shoes and must be removed upon completion of the tasks for which they are required. Employees exposed to electrical hazards must never wear conductive shoes.

  "title": "Force",
  "body": " Force  What is force? In simple terms, a force is a push or a pull. More precisely, a force is a vector quantity which tends to produce an acceleration of a body in the direction of its application. This means that if you want a stationary object to move, you must apply a force to it to get it going. If you want to keep it moving, you need to continuously apply a force to it to overcome friction, which is itself a force. Forces can exist without motion too – when an object is stationary it’s usually because there are many forces acting on it which cancel each other out, leaving no net force acting on the object. Forces always occur in pairs. A push on an object is always accompanied by an equal and opposite force acting on the pusher.  In the English system of units, force is measured in pounds, tons, or long tons. In the SI system, force is measured in newtons (N) or kilonewtons (kN). For estimation purposes, a newton is about a quarter of a pound.  One important force which we experience every day is weight. Weight is the force of gravity - the attraction between an object and the earth. The weight force exerted on an object is proportional to the mass of the object according to Newton’s second law, which states: where W is the weight, m is the mass, and g is the gravitational constant.  The constant g depends on where you are: on earth the constant is greater than it is on the moon, so you weigh less on the moon than you do on earth. In outer space, the constant is zero, making you weightless there. Be careful not to confuse weight with mass. The mass of an object will not change when it moves to another location, but its weight may. One reason why people often confuse weight with mass is because in the English system and on the surface of the earth, the gravitational constant g is equal to 1, and so one pound of mass has a weight of one pound of force. Move to the moon, and the pound of mass now weighs about six tenths of a pound. On earth in the SI system, g is approximately equal to 9.81 .  "

These units include inches of water, inches of mercury (Hg), or the height of some other liquid of known density. These units, while measured in length units, still represent a pressure. The length describes the pressure exerted by a column of liquid of the given height, and is known as the head .  For example, a pressure reading of 1 inch of water (1 in. H₂O) means that the exerted pressure is equal to the pressure exerted by a column of water 1 inch high, or that a column of water in a U-tube would be displaced 1 inch by the pressure being measured. Similarly, a reading of 12 inches of mercury (12 in. Hg) means that the measured pressure is sufficient to support a column of mercury 12 inches high.  What is really being expressed, even though it is not mentioned in the pressure unit, is the fact that a certain quantity of material (water, mercury, etc.) of known density will exert a certain definite force upon a specified area. Pressure is still force per unit area even if the pressure unit refers to the height of some liquid.  "

By common convention, gage pressure is always assumed when pressure is given in pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, or similar units. The g (for gage) is added only when there is some possibility of confusion. Absolute pressure, on the other hand, is always expressed as pounds per square inch absolute (psia), pounds per square foot absolute (psfa), and so forth.

  "body": " Vacuum  A pressure below atmospheric pressure is called a vacuum. The farther below the atmospheric pressure, the greater the vacuum. Vacuum can not be made greater and greater without limit, however. At some point, the absolute pressure drops as low as possible and a perfect vacuum is achieved. A perfect vacuum is the lowest possible pressure, or the absence of all pressure. When we speak of a high vacuum, we are talking about a low absolute pressure.  When measuring a vacuum, there are three possible methods. When vacuum is measured starting with zero at perfect vacuum and increasing as pressure rises, then the greater the value, the smaller the vacuum. This is known as the absolute pressure scale. We can also measure pressure on a scale starting at zero at atmospheric pressure, and indicating negative values when the pressure is below atmospheric (vacuum) and positive values when the pressure is above atmospheric. This is the behavior of a standard pressure gage. And finally, we can measure vacuum on a scale starting with zero at atmospheric pressure and increasing as the vacuum increases. Most vacuum gages operate this way. On this scale no vacuum would be indicated by 0 psig, and a perfect vacuum would be indicated by approximately 14.7 psi vacuum.  The most common scale used on vacuum gages aboard ship display vacuum in inches of mercury, with the vacuum gage scale marked from 0 to 30 inches of mercury. When this gage reads zero, the pressure in the space is the same as atmospheric pressure or, in other words, there is no vacuum. A vacuum gage reading of 29.92 inches of mercury would indicate a perfect (or nearly perfect) vacuum. In actual practice, it is impossible to obtain a perfect vacuum even under laboratory conditions.  "

  "body": " Work  Mechanical energy in transition is called work. When an object is moved through a distance against a resisting force, we say that work has been done. The formula for calculating work is:   Where:   = work (in foot-pounds)   = force (in pounds)   = distance moved in direction of applied force (in feet)    As you can see from this formula, you need to know how much force is exerted and the distance through which the force acts before you can find how much work is done. The unit of force is the pound. When work is done against gravity, the force required to move an object is equal to the weight of the object. Why? Because weight is a measure of the force of gravity or, in other words, a measure of the force of attraction between an object and the earth. How much work will you do if you lift that 5-pound rock from the bottom of the 100-foot cliff to the top? You will do 500 foot-pounds of work-the weight of the object (5 pounds) times the distance (100 feet) that you move it against gravity.  We also do work against forces other than the force of gravity. When you push an object across the deck, you are doing work against friction. In this case, the force you work against is not only the weight of the object; but also the force required to overcome friction and slide the object over the surface of the deck.  Notice that mechanical potential energy, mechanical kinetic energy and work are all measured in the same unit, foot-pounds. One foot-pound of work is done when a force of 1 pound acts through a distance of 1 foot. One foot-pound of mechanical potential energy or mechanical kinetic energy is the amount of energy that is required to accomplish 1 foot-pound of work.  "

When you lift a weight of 1 pound through a distance of 1 foot, you have done 1 foot-pound of work, regardless of whether you do it in half a second or half an hour. A device which can do a lot of work quickly is powerful. The common unit of measurement for power is the horsepower (hp). By definition, 1 horsepower is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute or 550 foot-pounds of work per second. Thus a machine that is capable of doing 550 foot-pounds of work per second is said to be a 1-horsepower machine. (As you can see, your horsepower rating would not be very impressive if you did 1 foot-pound of work in half an hour. Figure it out. It works out to be just a little more than one-millionth of a horsepower.)  "

Temperature is not energy and it’s not heat. It is simply a number related to the average kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance; the greater the average kinetic energy, the greater the temperature. Notice that temperature is not equal to the kinetic energy, just proportional to it, and temperature readings do not tell you anything directly about the potential energy of the substance.  Temperature can be measured in a variety of scales. When the temperature scale is measured up from the point where there is no molecular motion, it is known as an absolute scale, and is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the substance. The Kelvin and Rankine scales are absolute scales. We normally use the Fahrenheit or Celsius scales, which are offset from the corresponding absolute scale, and so are only indirectly related to the kinetic energy.  "

Because molecules are constantly in motion, they exert a pressure on the walls of the pipe, boiler, cylinder, or other object in which they are contained. Also, the temperature of any substance arises from, and is directly proportional to, the activity of the molecules. Therefore, every time you read thermometers and pressure gages you are finding out something about the amount of internal energy contained in the substance. High pressures and temperatures indicate that the molecules are moving rapidly and that the substance therefore has a lot of internal energy.  For most purposes, we will not need to distinguish between the two stored forms of thermal energy. Therefore, instead of referring to internal potential energy and internal kinetic energy, from now on we will simply use the term internal energy. By internal energy, then, we will mean the sum total of all internal energy stored in the substance or system because of the motion of the molecules and because of the forces of attraction between molecules.

  "title": "Heat",
  "body": " Heat   Heat is a more familiar term than internal energy, but may actually be more difficult to define correctly. The important thing to remember is that heat is thermal energy in transition - that is, it is thermal energy that is moving from one substance or system to another.  An example will help to illustrate the difference between heat and internal energy. Suppose there are two equal lengths of pipe made of identical materials and containing steam at the same pressure and temperature. One pipe is well insulated; the other is not insulated at all. From everyday experience you know that more heat will flow from the uninsulated pipe than from the insulated pipe. When the two pipes are first filled with steam, the steam in one pipe contains exactly as much internal energy as the steam in the other pipe. We know this is true because the two pipes contain equal volumes of steam at the same pressure and at the same temperature. After a few minutes, the steam in the uninsulated pipe will contain much less internal energy than the steam in the insulated pipe, as we can tell by measuring the pressure and the temperature of the steam in each pipe. What has happened? Stored thermal energy - internal energy - has moved from one system to another, first from the steam to the pipe, then from the uninsulated pipe to the air. This movement or flow of thermal energy from one system to another is called heat.  A good deal of confusion exists concerning the use of the word heat. For example, you will hear people say that a hot object contains a lot of heat when they really mean that it contains a lot of internal energy. Or you will hear that heat is added to or removed from a substance. Since heat is the flow of thermal energy, it can no more be added to a substance than the flow of water could be added to a river. (You might add water, and this addition might increase the flow; but you could hardly say that you had added flow.) The only kind of thermal energy that can in any sense be added to or removed from a substance is internal energy. The distinction between heat and internal energy must be clear in your own mind before you can understand the basic principles of a steam plant. Remember, steam contains internal energy but it does not contain heat. Heat exists when the internal energy flows from the steam to something else (another substance or system).  "

One consequence of this definition is that when heat flows into a substance at constant pressure, its enthalpy increases by the amount of heat energy added. This is why enthalpy is sometimes described as the heat content of a substance. Remember that heat is energy in transition, and is never stored so no substance ever really contains heat.  "

In this scale, the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure is designated 212°, and the freezing point is 32° with 180 equal degrees between. When working in the metric system, the Celsius scale is used. The Celsius scale (sometimes called the centigrade scale) uses zero as the freezing point of water and 100° as its boiling point, with 100 equal divisions or degrees between.  To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit: multiply by 1.8 and add 32. The British thermal unit (BTU) is used to measure heat. Originally, 1 BTU was defined as the quantity of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water through 1° on the Fahrenheit (F) scale. A similar unit called the calorie (cal) was originally defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water through 1° on the Celsius (C) scale. The BTU and calorie are still in use, but the original definitions have been abandoned by international agreement. These units are now defined in terms of the unit of energy called the joule. By definition, 1 BTU is equal to 1054.886 joules, and 1 cal is equal to 4.18605 joules. As may be seen, the BTU is a much larger unit than the calorie; 1 BTU is equal to approximately 252 cal.  "

  "title": "Heat Transfer",
  "body": " Heat Transfer  Heat can flow from one substance to another only when a temperature difference exists. Heat flow can occur only from a higher temperature to a lower temperature. When two objects at different temperatures are placed in contact with each other (or near each other), heat flows from the warmer object to the cooler one until both are at the same temperature. Heat transfer occurs at a faster rate when there is a larger temperature difference between the two objects. As the temperature difference approaches zero, the rate of heat transfer approaches zero.  Conduction, radiation, and convection are usually considered to be the three methods by which heat transfer can occur. It is more accurate, however, to consider conduction and radiation as the two basic methods of heat transfer and to consider convection separately as a special process which involves movement within a mass of fluid.   Conduction  Conduction is the method by which heat flows from a hotter to a colder substance when there is physical contact between the two substances. For example, consider a cold metal bar which is held firmly against a piece of red-hot metal. In a short time, the end of the bar which is not touching the hotter metal will have become too hot to hold. We say that heat has been conducted from molecule to molecule, throughout the entire bar. The process of conduction will continue as long as there is a temperature difference between the two ends of the bar.    Radiation  Radiation is a mode of heat transfer that does not require any physical contact between the warmer substance and the cooler substance. For example, a person sitting near a hot stove is warmed by radiant heat even though the air between the person and the stove may remain cold. Similarly, radiant heat from the sun warms the earth without warming the space through which it passes.    Convection  At the molecular or sub-molecular level, heat transfer takes place through both the processes of conduction and radiation. If we use the term heat transfer in a somewhat different way, we may also include convection as a mode of heat transfer. However, it is important to understand the difference between convection and the basic heat transfer processes of conduction and radiation.  If we put a hot brick into a wheelbarrow and wheel it across the street, we have in one sense transferred heat. However, any heat transfer that takes place between the brick and its surroundings while we are wheeling it across the street will be by conduction and by radiation. Therefore, it would really be more accurate to say that we have transported the brick and all its contained thermal energy from one side of the street to the other.  Convection occurs only in fluids – liquids, gases, and vapors – not in solids, such as the brick we have just transported in the wheelbarrow. Convection is the transportation or movement of some portions of a fluid within the total mass of the fluid. As this movement occurs, the moving portions of the fluid transfer their contained thermal energy from one part of the fluid to another. The effect of convection is thus to mix the various portions of the fluid; the part that was at the bottom of the container may move to the top, or the part that was at one side may move to the other side. As this mixing takes place, heat transfer occurs from one part of the fluid to another and between the fluid and its surroundings. But this heat transfer, like any other heat transfer, takes place by conduction and by radiation. In other words, convection transports portions of the fluid; conduction and radiation transfer the thermal energy.  Convection serves a vital purpose in bringing the different parts of the fluid into close contact so that heat transfer can occur. Without convection, there can be little heat transfer from or within fluids. Most fluids are poor conductors of heat when they are not in motion.  What causes this transportation of a mass of fluid? In the case of natural convection , the movement is caused by differences in the density of different parts of the fluid. The differences in density are usually caused by unequal temperatures within the mass of fluid. For example, as the air over a hot radiator is heated, it becomes less dense and therefore begins to rise. Cooler, heavier air is drawn in to replace the heated air, and convection currents are thus setup. Another example of natural convection is the circulation of water in a natural circulation boiler. As the water in the generating tubes is heated, it expands and becomes much lighter (less dense) than the cooler water in the downcomers. Therefore the hotter and lighter water rises, while the cooler and heavier water flows downward. The resulting circulation of water in the boiler is thus clearly an example of convection currents established by differences in temperature (and therefore differences in density) in various parts of the fluid.  In the case of forced convection , some mechanical device such as a pump or a fan produces the movement of the fluid. When the main feed pump moves feedwater toward the boiler, the water is transported by forced convection. The flow of combustion gases through a boiler is partly by natural convection and partly by forced convection. Natural convection occurs because the gases of combustion are hotter and lighter than air, so they tend to rise and go up the stack. Forced convection is also involved in this process, however, because the forced draft blowers supply an air pressure which increases the rate at which the combustion gases travel across the tubes and up the stack. When you stir a cup of hot coffee, you are forcing convection and thus increasing the rate of heat transfer. Natural convection currents would be set up in the coffee if you did not stir it, because differences in density would occur as some portions of the coffee cooled before others. If you want to cool the coffee rapidly, use forced convection (stirring). If you do not want it to cool so rapidly, wait for natural convection to do the job.  In summary, then, we use the term convection to describe the transportation, or loosely, the heat transfer of a mass of fluid and its contained thermal energy. However, the processes by which any substance gains or loses thermal energy are most accurately described in terms of conduction and radiation.   "

  "title": "Sensible Heat and Latent Heat",
  "body": " Sensible Heat and Latent Heat  The terms sensible heat and latent heat are often used to indicate the effect that the flow of heat has on a substance. The flow of heat from one substance to another is normally reflected in a temperature change in each substance-the hotter substance becomes cooler; the cooler substance becomes hotter. However, the flow of heat is not reflected in a temperature change in a substance that is in the process of changing from one physical state (solid, liquid, or gas) to another. When the flow of heat is reflected in a temperature change, we say that sensible heat has been added to or removed from the substance. When the flow of heat is not reflected in a temperature change but is reflected in the changing physical state of a substance, we say that latent heat has been added or removed.  Does anything bother you in this last paragraph? It should. Here we are, talking about adding and removing heat. And, furthermore, we are talking about sensible heat and latent heat as though we had two different kinds of heat to consider. As noted before, this is common (if inaccurate) engineering language. So keep the following points clear in your mind: (1) heat is the flow of thermal energy; (2) when we talk about adding and removing heat, we mean that we are providing temperature differentials so that thermal energy can flow from one substance to another; and (3) when we talk about sensible heat and latent heat, we are talking about two different kinds of effects that can be produced by heat, but not about two different kinds of heat.  The three basic physical states of all matter are solid,  liquid, and gas (or vapor). The physical state of a substance is closely related to the distance between molecules. The molecules are closest together in solids, farther apart in liquids, and farthest apart in gases. When the flow of heat to a substance is not reflected in a temperature change, we know that the energy is being used to increase the distance between the molecules of the substance and thus to change it from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. Such a change is known as a phase change . You might say that latent heat is the energy price that must be paid for a change of state from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. The energy is not lost; rather, it is stored in the substance as internal energy. The energy price is repaid, so to speak, when the substance changes back from gas to liquid or from liquid to solid.   Phase Changes     shows the relationship between sensible heat and latent heat for one substance, water, at atmospheric pressure. The same kind of chart could be drawn up for other substances; however, different amounts of thermal energy would of course be required for each change of temperature and for each change of physical state.  If we start with 1 pound of ice at 0 °F, we must add 16 BTU in order to raise the temperature of the ice to 32 °F. We call this adding sensible heat. To change the pound of ice at 32 °F to a pound of water at 32 °F, we must add 144 BTU (the latent heat of fusion ). There will be no change in temperature while the ice is melting. After all the ice has melted, however, the temperature of the water will be raised as additional heat is supplied. If we add 180 BTU that is, 1 BTU for each degree of temperature between 32 °F and 212 °F the temperature of the water will be raised to the boiling point. To change the pound of water at 212 °F, to a pound of steam at 212 °F, we must add 970 BTU (the latent heat of vaporization ). After all the water has been converted to steam, the addition of more heat will cause an increase in the temperature of the steam. If we add approximately 42 BTU to the pound of steam which is at 212 °F, we can superheat it to 300 °F.  The same relationships apply when heat is being removed. The removal of 42 BTU from the pound of steam which is at 300 °F will cause the temperature to drop to 212 °F. As the pound of steam at 212 °F changes to a pound of water at 212 °F, 970 BTU are given off. When a substance is changing from a gas or vapor to a liquid, we usually use the term latent heat of condensation for the heat that is given off. Notice, however, that the latent heat of condensation is exactly the same as the latent heat of vaporization. Only the terms differ to indicate whether a substance is being changed into a liquid or into a gas. The removal of another 180 BTU of sensible heat will lower the temperature of the pound of water from 212 °F to 32 °F. As the pound of water at 32 °F changes to a pound of ice at 32 °F 144 BTU are given off without any accompanying change of temperature. Further removal of heat causes the temperature of the ice to decrease.  "

However, we know that it takes 1 BTU (on the average) to raise the temperature of the same amount of water 1 °F. This difference occurs because the specific heat of water is about twice the specific heat of ice.  Specific heat is a thermal property of matter that must be determined experimentally for each substance. In general, we may say that specific heat is the property of matter; this explains the reason that equal quantities of thermal energy added to two different substances will not necessarily produce the same temperature rise, even when no change of state is involved. The specific heat of a substance is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of the substance 1 °F. For most engineering applications, specific heat is expressed in BTU per pound per degree Fahrenheit. In metric systems of measurement, specific heat is expressed in calories per gram per degree Celsius. Even though the units of measurement are different in the different systems, the numerical value of specific heat for any given substance is the same in all systems. The specific heat of water is 1.00 in all systems.  "

Still another way of expressing this principle is by the equation The energy out may be quite different in form from the energy in, but the total amount of energy input must always equal the total amount of energy output.  Another principle, the Principle of Conservation of Matter, states: Matter can be neither created nor destroyed, but only transformed. As you probably know, the development of the atomic bomb demonstrated that matter can be converted into energy; other developments have demonstrated that energy can be converted into matter. Therefore, the Principle of the Conservation of Energy and the Principle of the Conservation of Matter are no longer considered as two parts of a single law or principle but are combined into one principle: “Matter and energy are interchangeable, and the total amount of energy and matter in the universe is constant.\"  The interchangeability of matter and energy is mentioned here only to point out that the statement energy in must equal energy out is not strictly true for certain situations. However, any noticeable conversion of matter into energy or energy into matter can occur only under very special conditions that we need not consider now.

  "body": " Transforming Heat to Work  The energy transformation of primary interest in the shipboard steam plant is the transformation from heat to work. To see how this transformation occurs, we need to consider the pressure, temperature, and volume relationships which hold true for gases. These relationships may be summarized as follows:  When the temperature is held constant, increasing the pressure on a gas causes a proportional decrease in volume. Decreasing the pressure causes a proportional increase in volume.  When the pressure is held constant, increasing the temperature of a gas causes a proportional increase in volume. Decreasing the temperature causes a proportional decrease in volume.  When the volume is held constant, increasing the temperature of a gas causes a proportional increase in pressure. Decreasing the temperature causes a proportional decrease in pressure.    Suppose we have a boiler in which steam has just begun to form. With the steam stop valves still closed, the volume of the steam remains constant while the temperature and the pressure are both increasing. When operating pressure is reached and the steam stop valves are opened, the high pressure of the steam causes the steam to flow to the turbines. The pressure of the steam thus provides the potential for doing work; the actual conversion of heat to work is done in the steam turbines. The change in the internal energy (as indicated by changes in pressure and temperature) of the steam between the boiler and the condenser is an indication of the amount of heat that has been converted to work in the turbines.  Since heat is measured in BTU and work is measured in foot-pounds, how can we compare the amount of energy put in as heat with the amount of energy put out as work? At first glance, asking how much heat equals how much work might seem like asking how many lima beans equals playing baseball. However, the problem is not that difficult, since both heat and work are forms of energy. The formula for converting heat to work is or, in other words, the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water 1 °F is the same as the amount of energy required to lift a 1-pound weight 778 feet against the force of gravity.

  "body": " Energy Relationships in the Shipboard Propulsion Cycle  The movement of a ship through the water is the result of a number of energy transformations. Although most of these transformations have been mentioned, they have not been discussed in the proper sequence.  The first energy transformation occurs when fuel oil is burned in the boiler furnace. By the process of combustion, the chemical energy stored in the fuel oil is transformed into thermal energy. Thermal energy flows from the burning fuel to the water in the boiler, and steam is generated. The thermal energy is now stored as internal energy in the steam, as we can tell from the increased pressure and temperature of the steam. When the steam is admitted to the turbines, the thermal energy of the steam is converted into mechanical energy, which turns the shaft and drives the ship. Two main energy transformations are involved in converting thermal energy to work in a turbine. First, the thermal energy of the steam is transformed into mechanical kinetic energy (energy of motion) as the steam flows through one or more nozzles. Second, the mechanical kinetic energy of the steam is transformed into work (mechanical energy in transition) as the steam strikes the projecting blades of the turbine and thus causes the turbine to turn. The turning of the turbine rotor causes the propeller shaft to turn also, although at a slower speed, since the turbine is connected to the propeller shaft through reduction gears. The steam exhausts from the turbine to the condenser where it gives up its latent heat of condensation to the circulating seawater.  For the remainder of this cycle, energy is required to get the water (condensate and feedwater) back to the boiler where it will again be heated and changed into steam. The energy used for this purpose is generally the thermal energy of the auxiliary steam. In the case of turbine driven feed pumps, the conversion of thermal energy to mechanical energy occurs in the same way as it does in the case of the propulsion turbines. In the case of motor-driven pumps, the energy conversion is from thermal energy to electrical energy (in a turbogenerator) and then from electrical energy to mechanical energy (work) in the pumps.  As you can see, putting in 1 BTU at the boiler furnace does not mean that 778 foot-pounds of mechanical energy will be available for propelling the ship through the water. Some of the energy put in at the boiler furnace is used by auxiliary machinery such as pumps and forced-draft blowers to supply the boiler with feedwater, fuel oil, and air for combustion. Distilling plants, turbo-generators, steering gears, heating systems, galley and laundry equipment, and many other units throughout the ship use energy derived directly or indirectly from the energy put in at the boiler furnace.  In addition, there are many energy losses throughout the engineering plant. As we have seen, energy cannot actually be lost. But when it is transformed into a form of energy that we cannot use, we say there has been an energy loss. Since no insulation is perfect, some thermal energy is always lost as steam travels through the piping. Friction losses occur in all machinery and piping. There is also an energy loss at the condenser as the steam exhausted from the turbines gives up heat to the circulating seawater and turns into condensate.  Although some energy losses can be partly avoided by designing the machinery and equipment to minimize friction losses, by insulating hot surfaces, and by lubricating moving parts, some energy losses are still unavoidable. Consider, for example, the unavoidable energy loss that occurs at the condenser. To allow the flow of heat, the condenser must be at a lower temperature than the boiler since heat flow can occur only from a higher temperature area to a lower temperature area. Therefore, the energy loss at the condenser is not only unavoidable, but is also actually required for the conversion of heat to work.  As you can see, each BTU that is put in at the boiler furnace has to be divided in many ways before all the energy can be accounted for, but the energy account will always balance. Energy in will always equal Energy out.   "

  "title": "The Generation of Steam",
  "body": " The Generation of Steam  When a liquid boils, it generates a vapor, that is, some or all of the liquid changes its physical state from liquid to gas (or vapor). As long as the vapor is in contact with the liquid from which it is being generated, it remains at the same temperature as the boiling liquid. In this condition, the liquid and its vapor are said to be in equilibrium contact with each other.  The temperature at which a boiling liquid and its vapor may exist in equilibrium contact depends on the pressure under which the process takes place. As the pressure increases, the boiling temperature increases. As the pressure decreases, the boiling temperature decreases. For each liquid, therefore, the boiling point is determined by the pressure.  When a liquid is boiling and generating vapor, the liquid is called a saturated liquid , and the vapor is called a saturated vapor . The temperature at which a liquid boils under a given pressure is called the saturation temperature , and the corresponding pressure is called the saturation pressure . For each pressure there is a corresponding saturation temperature, and for each temperature there is a corresponding saturation pressure. A few saturation pressures and temperatures for water are listed below.  Atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia at sea level and lesser at higher altitudes. Trying to cook potatoes at the top of a high mountain takes a great deal longer than it would at sea level. Why is this? As noted before, temperature and pressure are indications of internal energy. Since it is not possible to raise the temperature of the boiling water above the saturation temperature for that pressure, the amount of internal energy available for cooking the potatoes is much less at high altitudes than it is at sea level. By the same line of reasoning, you should be able to figure out why the potatoes cook faster in a pressure cooker than in an open kettle.  A peculiar thing happens to water and steam at an absolute pressure of 3206.2 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature at 705.40 °F. At this point, which is called the critical point, the vapor and the liquid are indistinguishable. No change of state occurs when the pressure is increased above this point or when heat is added. At the critical point, we can no longer refer to water or steam, since we cannot tell the water and steam apart. Instead, the substance is merely called a fluid or a working substance. Boilers designed to operate at pressures and temperatures above the critical point are called supercritical boilers. Supercritical boilers are not used, at present, in propulsion plants of ships; however, some boilers of this type are used in stationary steam power plants.  If we generate steam by boiling water in an open pan at atmospheric pressure, the water and the steam which is in immediate contact with the water will remain at 212 °F until all the water has been evaporated. If we fit an absolutely tight cover to the pan, so that no steam can escape while we continue to add heat, both the pressure and the temperature inside the vessel will rise. The steam and water will both increase in temperature and pressure, and each fluid will be at the same temperature and pressure as the other.  In operation, a boiler is neither an open vessel nor a closed vessel. Instead, it is a vessel designed with restricted openings which allow steam to escape at a uniform rate while feedwater is being brought in at a uniform rate. After boiler operating pressure has been reached, therefore, the process of steam generation in a boiler takes place at constant pressure and constant temperature, if we disregard any fluctuations that may be caused by changes in steam demands.  Although it is impossible to raise the temperature of the steam in the steam drum above the temperature of the water from which it is being generated, we can raise the temperature of the steam if we first remove the steam from contact with the water inside the steam drum and then add heat. Steam which has been heated above its saturation temperature for any given pressure is called superheated steam , and the vessel in which the saturated steam is superheated is called a superheater. The amount by which the temperature of the superheated steam exceeds the temperature of saturated steam at the same pressure is known as the degree of superheat . For example, if saturated steam at a pressure of 620 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature of 490 °F is superheated to 790 °F, the degree of superheat is 300 °F.  All ship’s propulsion boilers are equipped with superheaters. The primary advantage is that superheating the steam provides a greater temperature differential between the boiler and the condenser, thus allowing more heat to be converted to work at the turbines. Another advantage is that superheated steam is dry and therefore causes relatively little corrosion or erosion of machinery and piping. Also, superheated steam does not conduct heat as rapidly (and therefore does not lose heat as rapidly) as saturated steam. The increased efficiency which results from the use of superheated steam reduces the amount of fuel oil required to generate each pound of steam, and so reduces the space and weight requirements for the boilers.  It should be noted, however, that most auxiliary machinery is designed to operate on saturated steam. Reciprocating machinery in particular requires saturated steam for the lubrication of internal moving parts of the steam end. Ship’s boilers, therefore, are designed to produce both saturated steam and superheated steam.  "

  "body": " Electrical Properties   Voltage , or electric potential difference , is a fundamental concept in electricity. Voltage is measured in units of volts (V), and symbolized as . Voltage can be seen as the push or force that propels electric charges within a circuit. When voltage is applied to a circuit, it creates an electric field that influences the movement of charged particles, resulting in the establishment of an electric current. In simpler terms, voltage serves as the driving force behind the flow of electric charges in an electrical system.  Voltage can be produced through several methods, including chemical reactions (such as in batteries) and the photovoltaic effect (as in solar cells). However, the most important method of is electromagnetic induction . Electromagnetic induction is the process where a changing magnetic field induces (creates) an electric voltage in a nearby conductor. This phenomenon is the basis for generating electricity in devices like generators and transformers. Electrical generators will be described in more detail in    Current refers to the flow of electric charge in an electrical circuit. It is the rate at which electric charges, typically electrons, move through a conductor . Current is measured in amperes (A) and is represented by the symbol . It can be thought of as the quantity of charge passing through a point in a circuit per unit of time. The flow of current occurs when there is a potential difference (voltage) applied across a conductor, providing the driving force for the movement of electric charges.   Resistance is a property of a material or component in an electrical circuit that opposes the flow of electric current. It is measured in ohms (Ω) and is denoted by the symbol . Resistance determines the extent to which a material or device hinders the flow of electrical charge. When a voltage is applied across a conductor, the resistance restricts the flow of current, resulting in a decrease in the magnitude of the current. Materials with high resistance impede the flow of electricity more than materials with low resistance. The resistance of a component depends on factors such as its length, cross-sectional area, and the material it is made of.   Ohm’s law describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. According to Ohm's Law, the current flowing through a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage across it and inversely proportional to the resistance of the circuit. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as where:   is the the current in amperes   is the voltage in volts, and   is the resistance in ohms (Ω).    In other words, an increase in voltage leads to a corresponding increase in current if the resistance remains constant, while an increase in resistance results in a decrease in current for a given voltage.

  "body": " Electrical Circuits  An electrical circuit is a complete loop or path that allows for the regulated flow of electric current to power devices and carry out different tasks. It consists of different elements like voltage sources, switches, and electrical loads that are interconnected through wires. Electrical loads refer to devices that consume electrical energy and convert it into another form like mechanical work, light, or heat. Motors, light bulbs and heating elements are some common examples of electrical loads.   Series Circuit : In a series circuit, the components are connected in a single path such that the same current flows through each component. The components are connected end-to-end, creating a sequential circuit. In a series circuit, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, and the total voltage across the circuit is divided among the components. If one component fails or is disconnected, the entire circuit is broken, and the flow of current stops.   Parallel Circuit : In a parallel circuit, the components are connected in multiple paths, allowing the current to divide and flow through different branches simultaneously. Each component in a parallel circuit has the same voltage across it. The total current in the circuit is divided among the branches based on the resistance of each branch. If one component fails or is disconnected in a parallel circuit, the current can still flow through the remaining branches.  In summary, a series circuit has components connected in a single path with the same current flowing through each component, while a parallel circuit has components connected in multiple paths, allowing current to divide among the branches.

  "title": "Globe Valves",
  "body": " Globe Valves  Globe valves are used in throttling applications, that is, anytime you want to regulate or control the amount of liquid flowing through a system, you could select a globe valve. A bathroom sink faucet or a garden hose spigot are common examples of globe valves found around the house. In a globe valve, the moving part (called the valve disk ) blocks an opening in the valve (called the seat ) to shut off flow, and when the valve stem is turned, the disk moves away from the seat – in the path of the fluid flow – as the valve is opened. To close the globe valve, the disk is moved back towards the seat until they touch, seal, and stop the fluid flow through the valve.   Globe Valve     Construction  Globe valves are designed for tight closure and throttling applications. When a globe valve is used to throttle or regulate fluid flow, the disk surface that closes against the seat should be made from metal, not synthetic materials. Throttling a fluid creates erosion (wearing away) of the disk surface and the seat surface that the fluid flows between. This erosion may show up as general roughness or as small grooves cut across the surfaces of the seat and disk, called wire drawing . These defects on the precisely machined surfaces of the seat and disk result in leakage when the valve is closed. In service where erosion will be a problem, the seat and disk can be fabricated from very hard materials, such as stellite, to extend the life of the seat and disk contact surfaces.  The valve body contains the internal opening that the fluid flows through. It is called the seat if the opening is machined directly into the valve body material. It is called a seat ring if it is a separate and replaceable part from the valve body. Replaceable seat rings are generally manufactured from harder, longer wearing materials than the valve body to be more resistant to fluid erosion at this location. Seat rings may be retained in the valve body by machine screw threads, press fit, welding or by what is known as a shrink fit . In shrink fit applications, the machined hole in the valve body that the seat ring fits into is a few thousandths of an inch smaller in diameter than the outside diameter of the seat ring. Therefore, it is impossible for the ring to fit into the hole in the valve body. During assembly the valve body is heated, causing the machined seat ring hole to expand. The seat ring is also frozen at the same time to decrease its outside diameter. With both parts at the proper temperature, the seat ring now has an outside diameter that is smaller than the inside diameter of the machined hole in the valve body. At this point, the seat ring is placed quickly and accurately into the valve body. As the temperature of the two parts begin to equalize, the ring expands and the machined hole shrinks and places a compressive force around the outside of the ring, locking it very tightly in place.  The valve body has two external openings (and in some special valves, more) for the entrance and exit of fluid from the piping system. These openings can be connected to the piping using pipe threads, soldering, flanges, welding, or gluing.  The top of the valve body generally has an opening for the valve disk and stem to fit through. At this opening, the other sub-assembly, called the bonnet is attached.  The bonnet normally contains the equipment necessary to operate the movable disk. It is attached to the body by machine screw threads or flanges . Large valves and valves in high pressure service normally have a gasket between the bonnet and the body made from sheet packing, flat metallic rings or spiral wound metallic type material. Small valves may have the bonnet and body sealed by a lapped metal to metal fit with no gaskets.   Angle Globe Valve     Construction Details. Several interesting construction details are shown in , which shows a manually operated right-angle globe valve.  This valve has a stem with a collar machined on the end. The disk slides over the collar and is retained on the end of the stem by a valve disk plug (or disk nut ) which is attached to the disk by machine threads. Since the disk plug is prevented from sliding off the end of the stem by the collar, it effectively fastens the disk to the stem. The disk nut does not lock the disk tightly to the stem, rather the disk is allowed to move slightly around the collar on the end of the valve stem. This small movement allows the disk to align itself properly with the seat as it closes for a leak free seal. In this valve, the stem is also the device that keeps the disk correctly aligned with the seat, regardless of how far the disk is removed from the seat.  Where the valve stem passes through the bonnet to the outside of the valve, the bonnet has a stuffing box , packing , and a packing gland installed to minimize fluid leakage at this point.  This valve stem uses Acme Threads , a thread type with no points, just below the point where the hand-wheel is installed. The valve stem threads engage the internal threads of the yolk bushing , which is made from a softer material than the valve stem, e.g. bronze, brass etc. If the stem has too much rotational force applied, the yoke bushing threads strip instead of the valve stem threads. The yoke bushing is a replaceable part and is screwed into the upper part of the bonnet with machine threads. When the valve hand-wheel is turned in the clockwise direction, the valve stem threads engaged with the yoke bushing threads cause the stem to move inward pushing the disk toward the seat closing the valve.  The upper part of the bonnet on this particular valve is split into two supporting uprights from the area where the packing gland is installed to the location of the yoke bushing. This type of upper bonnet design is called an outside yolk and stem.    Installation  Globe valves are normally installed with the incoming fluid pressure applied to the bottom of the valve disk, that is, to the side of the disk that closes against the seat. The top of the disk is the side that does not close against the seat and, in most globe valves, is the side in contact with the valve stem. When fluid pressure is applied to the bottom of the disk, the pressure helps the operator open the valve, and the pressure on the valve packing is relieved when the valve is closed.  The only time a globe valve is installed with fluid pressure applied to the top of the disk is when the valve is used as a throttle valve controlling steam flow to an engine. Installed in this manner, if the disk were to become detached from the stem, the disk would be carried toward the seat by the steam flow. Even if the disk does not close tightly against the seat, it would choke off steam flow to the engine and cause it to slow down. Globe throttle valves installed in this manner are considered fail safe. If the valve was installed with the steam pressure on the bottom of the disk, and the disk became detached from the stem, the disk would be carried away from the seat by the steam flow and cause the engine speed to rise uncontrollably. The steam would also carry the disk toward the engine where it could enter and cause damage.  Globe valves cause a relatively large pressure drop in the fluid as it flows through the valve. Pressure drops are caused by the friction created when the fluid changes direction of flow through the valve. The straight globe valve, with the pipe connections 180 degrees opposite each other, has the greatest pressure drop through it due to three to five changes in direction of fluid flow. The right angle valve has a 90 degree angle between the inlet and outlet pipe connections and fluid flow only changes direction one or two times, creating less pressure drop than the straight type. Globe valves are also constructed with 45 or 60 degree angles between the stem and the outlet side of the valve. This valve design also creates less change in direction of fluid flow, reducing pressure drop through the valve.  A globe valve is fully open when the disk is raised ¼ of the diameter, d , of the seat opening. For full flow to take place through the globe valve, the area the fluid flows in through and the area the fluid flows out through must be equal. The inlet area is the hole in the seat, and is equal to the area of a circle or . The fluid flows out through the space between the top of the seat and the bottom of the disk which is the side of a cylindrical shape. The area of the side of a cylinder is equal to the circumference of the circle on the end of the cylinder times the height, h of the cylinder .   example   If the inside diameter of the seat is 4\" how far from the seat must the disk be lifted to be fully open?     = 1 in          "

  "title": "Gate Valves",
  "body": " Gate Valves   Rising Stem Gate Valve    A gate valve, , is called for when you don’t need to regulate flow, only turn it on or off. To open a gate valve, the moving part, called the gate or wedge , is moved across to the fluid flow path unblocking the opening in the valve, called the seat . The gate is actually slid off the surface of the seat sideways. Sliding the gate back over the seat blocks fluid flow and closes the valve.  When open, fluids follow a straight, unobstructed path through the valve creating a minimal pressure drop across the valve. This is the principle advantage of a gate valve over a globe valve; it has a much lower restriction to flow when fully open.  Gate valves are designed to be fully open or fully closed. They should not be left partially open to regulate fluid flow. The fluid flow under a partially open gate causes the gate to swing back and forth. This could cause the gate to hit the seats (sometimes called chattering ) creating damage to the machined surfaces of the seat and gate leading to leakage when the valve is closed.  A gate valve, like a globe valve, is constructed in two basic parts, the body, and the bonnet.   Gate Valve     Body  Piping inlet and outlet connections are fitted to the body 180° apart only , similar to the straight globe valve. Piping connections to the body are the same as a globe valve: threaded, flanged, etc.  The body has two seats inside facing each other. One surrounds the inlet opening and the other the outlet opening. The distance between the seats nearest the bonnet opening is greater than the distance between the seats at the bottom of the valve body creating a wedge shape between them. The gate is moved down from the bonnet location between the two seats. It has a machined surface on both sides and has a wedge shape that matches the two seats forcing it to seal tightly against both seats when it is pushed down between them.  The upper part of the body and sometimes the lower part of the bonnet form a large cavity for the gate to retract into as the valve is opened. Since the gate slides off the seats sideways, it must be moved more than the full diameter of the seat opening to be fully open. This is why most gate valves are taller than globe valves of a comparable size.    Bonnet  The bonnet houses the equipment necessary to operate the gate and is attached and sealed to the body using the same methods as on globe valves.   Types of Bonnets    Gate valves are available in different types of stem connections. illustrates three different types.   Non-rising stem, inside screw (A) The stem screws down into the valve gate as the valve is opened. In this type the stem does not rise or fall outside the valve body as the valve is opened or closed, it simply rotates.   Rising stem, inside screw (B) The stem rises outside the valve as the valve is opened, but the stem screw operates inside the body of the valve. When operated, the valve stem in this design rises and rotates.    Rising stem, outside screw and yoke (C) The stem screw operates at the level of the hand-wheel, so the stem rises independently of the hand-wheel as the valve is opened. The valve stem rises, but does not rotate. Instead of the valve stem rotating, the hand-wheel rotates the yoke bushing pulling the stem straight up. Valve stem threads can be easily cleaned and lubricated in this design.  Outside screw and yoke design is required on gate valves when diameters exceed 3\" and pressures exceed 600 psig.     Notice that in both type A and B, the stem threads are exposed to the fluids flowing through the valve. Fluids can eventually corrode the threads and fluids with solids entrained can cause the threads to bind up and create excessive wear.  Valves with rising stems are used when it is important to know by immediate inspection whether the valve is opened or closed. The outside screw and yoke type easily indicates valve position due to the stem extending out beyond the center of the valve wheel when it is open.  The non-rising type is the least likely to leak in the packing area and requires less installation space.   "

  "title": "Check Valves",
  "body": " Check Valves   Check Valves    A check valve is a modified globe valve that allows fluid flow in one direction only, through a pipe line and automatically stops flow in the opposite direction. A check valve has two basic parts: the body which is similar to the body of a globe valve – with one seat, two external pipe connections, and an opening for the bonnet to attach to; and the Cover or Cap which replaces the globe valve bonnet assembly and fastens to the body using the same methods used to attach bonnets on globe valves. However, the cap is a blank cover with no hand operators, stuffing box or valve stem.  There are three main variations of check valves: swing checks , lift checks , and stop checks , and they are discussed below.   Swing Check  In a swing check valve the valve seat is angled 45° to the fluid flow path through the valve. The disk is attached by an arm to a hinge pin inside the valve body near the cover opening. The hinge pin is located just above the highest part of the seat opening. When the fluid flow is from right to left and the pressure on the bottom of the disk is greater than the pressure on the top of the disk, the disk swings away from the seat allowing flow to take place. When fluid flow tries to reverse (from left to right), the pressure on top of the disk becomes greater than the pressure on the bottom of the disk, the disk to moves back toward the seat, preventing flow in this direction. The arm and hinge pin assembly assure correct alignment between the disk and seat for a tight closure.    Lift Check  A lift check valve has a specially designed disk or ball which closes against a seat just like a typical globe valve. In this design, the disk or ball is not attached to any arm or stem. Since the disk is free to move away from the seat without an arm or stem to guide it back in correct alignment to the seat upon closing, other guidance means are employed. In most lift check valves, the disk (with higher than normal sides) or the ball just fits into to hole in the upper part of the body. When flow pushes the disk or ball away from the seat, the walls of the hole in the upper body guide the disk or ball straight up away from the seat. These walls also guide the disk straight down when it is closing assuring correct alignment between the disk and seat for tight closure.    Stop Check  A stop-check valve is very similar to a globe valve, except that the disk is not attached to the stem. When the valve hand-wheel is turned to the fully closed position the disk is held against the seat and the valve is securely closed. When the valve hand-wheel is turned to open the valve, the disk is free to lift off the seat, and will when there is a pressure difference in the correct direction. If the flow reverses direction, the valve will automatically close like a lift check valve.  The valve stem can be used to force the disk to a partially closed position to regulate the flow, or to a fully closed position to stop the flow, but the valve stem cannot be used to force the disk into the open position. Once the stem is moved away from the disk, the valve functions like a lift check valve.  A typical application would be a boiler feedwater stop-check valve. The valve can be used to stop or regulate feedwater flow to the boiler. It also automatically prevents the back flow of water out of the boiler through the feedwater line if the pressure in the feedwater line falls below the boiler steam pressure. In this application, it functions as a check valve.  In some designs, a stop-check valve can be converted to a regular globe valve, which eliminates the check function and allows the disk to be forced into the open position, by reinstalling the disk nut or drilling a hole through the upper disk and valve stem and inserting a pin to lock them together.   When installing a check valve, always remember: Check valves must be installed in a manner that allows gravity to help close the disk. This way the valve will close even if the flow reversal is only slight. Swing checks are normally installed in piping systems with the cap up, and lift checks are installed with the disks closing in the downward direction. There is usually a directional arrow on the valve body which indicates the direction of fluid flow.  "

  "title": "Plug-type Valves",
  "body": " Plug-type Valves   Plug Valve    Plug-type valves have a rotating element with a hole drilled or cast through it. When the hole lines up with the matching passages in the valve body, fluid can flow through the valve. Variations of plug valves are pet cocks, cylinder valves or ball valves.   Plug Valves   Plug valves , , have a through-ported cylindrical or tapered plug which can rotate in a close-fitting body. Alignment of the ports (holes) in the plug with those in the body permit fluid flow.  Operation of a plug valve requires rotating the handle or lever on the plug stem 90 degrees. Normally the plug valves (for the most common type with two pipe connections 180 degrees apart) position (open or closed) can be determined by looking at the operating lever. When the lever is parallel to the piping system, the valve is open. When the lever is perpendicular to the piping system, the valve is closed.  Plugs valves have limited throttling ability and should be used like gate valves, either fully open or closed.  Plug valves may be built with multiple openings in the plug and multiple ports in the valve body. These designs allow a variety of fluid flow directions through the plug valve by proper positioning of the operating lever. Pointers attached to the plug stem or operating lever are sometimes used to indicate direction of flow.  When a plug valve is described as three-way, two-port it means the valve body has three openings to pipe connections on the outside of the body. Two port means the plug has two openings in it that fluid flows in and out through.    Ball Valves   Ball Valve    A ball valve , , is similar to a plug valve except that a spherical rather than cylindrical plug is used. The ball has a hole or port bored through it and is made tight to the two openings in the body by plastic or synthetic rubber seat seal rings. These plastic or synthetic seat rings limit most ball valves to fluid temperatures of 350° or less. When the ball is rotated to the closed position, the fluid pressure pushes the ball tightly against the outlet seat ring insuring tight closure.  Ball valves are compact, self-sealing, non-sticking, require little effort to rotate the valve stem and they provide smooth fluid flow. Since the port in the ball is normally the same I.D. as the piping, the ball valve offers little resistance to flow and low pressure drop.   "

  "body": " Butterfly Valves   Butterfly Valve     Butterfly valves can be used for on-off operation as well as throttling or regulating fluid flow. They are light weight, require little installation space, have low initial cost, are simple in design and can be easily repaired. Like plug and ball type valves, it is only necessary to rotate the valve stem a quarter turn on a butterfly valve to go from the full open to the closed position. Manual operating levers on butterfly valves are parallel to the piping when the valve is open and perpendicular to the piping when the valve is closed. 90° valve stem operation makes them very adaptable to automatic and remote control actuators.  The disk in the butterfly valve is connected to the stem across its diameter. (See and ). When closed, the outer edge of the disk is in contact with a seat ring surrounding the opening through the valve body. To open the valve, the stem rotates the valve disk, until when fully open, the flat surfaces of the disk are parallel to the centerline of the pipe with fluid flowing past each side of the disk.  The seat opening is lined with resilient, elastic materials like synthetic rubber, neoprene or Teflon. The disk edge presses into this material when closed to form a tight seal.   Exploded view, Butterfly valve    In symmetrical type butterfly valves (stem is centered on the thickness of the disk), a tight seal is a problem where the stem passes off the edge of the disk. Symmetrical butterfly valves are generally satisfactory for tightly sealing fluid leakage in fluid systems up to approximately 200 psig and 180 °F.  To improve sealing, the eccentric or offset design butterfly valves are used. The stem is offset to one side of the disk so it does not interrupt the edge of the disk’s seal with seat ring. The stem may also be installed across the disk to one side of the maximum diameter. This allows a major portion of the disk’s edge to push it’s way into the seat material rather than slide into it.  Offset butterfly valves seal tightly and have reasonable seat ring life up to about 700 psig with water to temperatures slightly above ambient. Pressure ratings drop with the rise in temperature with maximum temperature limits being 450 to 500 °F.  "

  "title": "Pressure Relief Valves",
  "body": " Pressure Relief Valves   Relief valves are protective devices designed to open automatically when the pressure in the line unit becomes too high. Although there are different types of relief valves, the most common type has a disk that is held in the closed position by a coil spring. When the pressure in the line or machine creates a force great enough to overcome the spring force, the disk moves upward and is opened. After the pressure has been relieved by the escape of fluid through the relief valve, the spring again exerts enough force to close the disk.   Relief Valve    Relief valves have no hand-wheel operator, but may be equipped with a lever attached to the valve stem which the operator can use to momentarily open the valve, in order to test that the valve can open properly, or to blow out debris such as rust or dirt, which if lodged between the disk and seat would cause the valve to leak.  Relief valves are designed to work properly with any type of fluid, while safety valves are only designed to work with gases.  Most relief valves are set to open when the pressure against the disk reaches 110% of the Maximum Allowable Working Pressure (called the MAWP) of the system or machine. For example, if a system operates with a MAWP of 100 psi, then the relief valve would open at 110 psi.  Relief valves are designed to close at a pressure lower than their opening pressure (The difference between opening and closing pressure is called blowdown ). This is done to prevent valve chattering , which is a rapid opening and closing of the valve. Chattering is undesirable because it can damage the seat and disk. If the valve opened and closed at exactly the same pressure, it would chatter, because as soon as it opened, the pressure would drop and cause the valve to close, and as soon as it closed the pressure would cause it to open again.  Chattering is prevented by exposing an additional disk surface area to the fluid pressure immediately after the valve opens. This increased area, acted upon by the fluid pressure, increases the force against the spring, and makes the valve open rapidly once it starts to open, but it will not close again until the pressure falls significantly below the opening pressure.  It must be remembered that the coil spring force acting when the valve begins to open is the same as the spring force acting when the valve closes. Since : Where:   is the Opening pressure.   is the Closing pressure.   is the Opening area.   is the Closing area.    Remember, the extra surface area is not available until the valve disk opens.   Relief Valve Closing Pressure   A relief valve opens at 250 psi and has a bottom surface area when closed of 0.75 . When the valve opens, the bottom surface area increases by 10%. What pressure does the valve close at?              "

  "body": " Suction Head  The distance between the surface of the liquid in the supply tank and the centerline of the pump suction describes the pump suction head .   Positive suction head , also called gravity head, occurs when the liquid level in the supply tank is above the center of the pump suction. The height of the liquid creates a pressure on the suction side of the pump that is greater than atmospheric pressure, and gravity causes the liquid to flow into the pump suction. In this situation, very little power is required to draw the liquid into the pump.   Negative suction head , also called suction lift , occurs when the liquid level in the supply tank is below the center of the pump suction. In this case, the pump must create the force necessary to lift the liquid uphill against the force of gravity and draw it into the pump suction. This process obviously requires more pumping power than when there is a positive suction head.  To pump when there is a suction lift, we use the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the liquid in the supply tank to push the liquid up the pipe to the pump suction, much like sucking on a straw. If the pressure inside the suction pipe is reduced to 13.7 psia compared to the 14.7 psia on the surface of the water in the supply tank, than the water level in the suction pipe should be 2.31 feet higher than the water level in the supply tank. (remember: 1 psi = 2.31 feet of fresh water!). Now if the pressure in the suction pipe is lowered to 0 psia, the atmospheric pressure should theoretically push the water up against the force of gravity (14.7 x 2.31 = 33.96 feet) 34 feet inside the suction pipe. The suction side of the pump will be operating at a pressure lower than atmospheric (under a vacuum) when the pump is lifting. 34 feet of suction lift is the theoretical maximum for fresh water, but in the real world, the maximum suction lift is less.

  "body": " By Displacement Characteristics  A positive displacement pump is one in which a definite volume of liquid is delivered for each cycle of pump operation, regardless of the discharge pressure the pump operates against, and provided the capacity of the power unit driving the pump is not exceeded.  A non-positive displacement pump is one in which the volume of liquid delivered for each operational pump cycle depends on the resistance to flow in the discharge line. This type of pump produces a force on the liquid that is constant for each particular operating speed of the pump. Pressure in the discharge line produces a force in the opposite direction. When these two forces are equal, the liquid is in a state of equilibrium and does not flow.  If the discharge valve of a positive displacement pump is completely closed, the discharge pressure will rise to a point where either the unit driving the pump will stall or parts of the pump exposed to discharge pressure will fail. This situation should be avoided. On the other hand, closing the discharge valve on a non-positive displacement pump will cause the discharge pressure to rise to a maximum for that type of pump operating at a specific speed. Nothing more will happen except the pump will churn the liquid trapped in the pump chamber and produce frictional heat in the liquid.  Most positive displacement pumps deliver liquid in slugs, with no delivery in between, and this causes a rise then a drop in discharge pressure and flow. Pumps equipped with many small pumping chambers generally have overlapping delivery that minimizes this effect. Non-positive displacement pumps deliver a practically continuous even flow for a given operating speed and discharge pressure.  "

  "body": " Centrifugal Pumps   Centrifugal pumps use centrifugal force to transfer the mechanical energy supplied to the pump into primarily kinetic energy (velocity) in the fluid being pumped. Centrifugal force is the force generated by rotation which acts outward from the center of rotation. Using the terminology already covered, centrifugal pumps are classified as: non-positive displacement pumps, non-self priming, and are constant delivery for a given operating speed and discharge pressure. Because of their simplicity, low cost and ability to operate under a wide variety of conditions, centrifugal pumps are widely used. They can be adapted to produce any head up to several thousand feet and will handle liquids at temperatures up to 1000° F. They can also be designed to handle liquids containing a high proportion of rather large solid particles.   Centrifugal Pump    A centrifugal pump consists of a rotating element called the impeller , which is the only moving part in the pump, and a specially shaped housing, or pump casing. In practically all centrifugal pumps, liquid enters the rotating element at the center through the eye , and is given a rotary motion in the pump chamber by the rotation of a number of impeller blades (generally called vanes ). The rotation of the impeller in a true centrifugal pump does two things. Centrifugal force drives the liquid directly out from the center of the impeller, setting up a greater pressure in the chamber at the outer edge of the impeller than at the eye. At the same time the liquid is also pushed around and around by the turning of the vanes, and is given more and more velocity as it moves farther out from the eye. The liquid finally leaves the impeller tangentially at the end of the vanes with a high velocity, and flows into the discharge passage of the pump housing surrounding the impeller.  The discharge passage gradually widens as it leads the liquid away from the impeller to the discharge nozzle on the pump housing. The gradual widening of the discharge passage reduces the velocity of the liquid. Since the reduction in velocity does not produce work, it results in a change in the type of energy contained in the liquid. Most of the velocity (kinetic energy) in the liquid produced by the centrifugal pump is transformed into pressure (potential energy) by the widening discharge passage. This type of energy is more available for doing work. On most centrifugal pumps this widening passage is built into the pump casing that surrounds the impeller and is called the volute . Additional conversion of velocity to pressure may be accomplished in the discharge nozzle and sometimes in the piping leading away from the pump.  Recall that a reduction in the velocity of a liquid (without producing any work) changes the type of energy contained in the liquid into increased pressure. The reverse is also true. If the pressure in a liquid is reduced (without producing any work) then the velocity of the liquid must increase.)  When liquid is forced away from the eye by centrifugal force, a reduced pressure area is created in the eye causing more liquid to flow in. This creates a constant flow through the impeller and out through the discharge of the centrifugal pump.  In a centrifugal pump, the velocity that can be imparted to the liquid, and the resulting discharge pressure depends upon both the impeller diameter and the impeller RPM. Increasing either results in:  higher centrifugal force  higher liquid velocity  higher pressure    The centrifugal pump, with a certain size impeller operating at a set speed, will only put enough energy in the liquid to create a specific discharge pressure. If the resistance in the discharge piping rises to the maximum pressure the pump can create, liquid flow through the pump stops. The centrifugal pump is said to be operating at its shut-off head and no liquid is delivered by the pump. Friction between the rotating impeller and the liquid trapped in the pump casing increases the liquid temperature, possibly causing it to vaporize. To prevent vaporization of the liquid in a high speed centrifugal pump handling very hot liquids, a small pipeline is installed on the discharge side of the pump to divert a small amount of liquid back to the supply tank on the suction side of the pump. This small quantity of liquid flowing through the pump acts as a cooling system constantly removing the heated liquid from the pump casing and replacing it with cooler liquid from the supply tank. These lines are called recirculating lines and are always found on shipboard turbine-driven centrifugal feed pumps because they are frequently subjected to shut-off head when the ship’s main engine is stopped or maneuvering.  Impeller vanes which curve backwards with respect to their direction of rotation are more efficient and give better performance than straight vanes; however, the pump must be turned in the correct direction to obtain this efficiency. The advantage of straight vane impellers is that they have the same efficiency in either direction of pump rotation. In , the impeller rotation is counter-clockwise allowing the liquid to be pushed around the pump chamber by the vanes, rather than being carried by them. If a curved vane impeller was operated in the wrong direction rotation, it would still deliver some liquid, but the following would be observed:  The pump would require more power to turn the impellor backwards.  The pump discharge capacity would decrease.  The pump efficiency would decrease.     Centrifugal Pump Design  Centrifugal pumps come in two basic designs, volute and diffuser , and many variations, including: single - or double-suction , single or multiple stages, and horizontal or vertical layout.  In the volute pump , the one most commonly used, the impeller discharges into a progressively expanding casing, as shown in . The casing is proportioned to produce equal velocity of flow all around the circumference of the casing and then gradually to reduce the velocity as the liquid passes from the casing into the nozzle to be discharged from the pump, thereby transforming a considerable part of the velocity head into pressure head.   Diffuser Type Centrifugal Pump    In the diffuser pump , the impeller is surrounded by gradually expanding passages formed by stationary guide vanes, sometimes called a diffusion ring, as shown in . In these expanding passages the direction of flow is changed and velocity largely converted to pressure before the liquid enters the volute. It is worth noting that the diffuser vanes are set approximately tangent to the ends of the impeller blades. In this kind of casing, efficiency may be slightly higher than in volute pumps, since velocity is more completely converted into pressure. The added cost of manufacture and more complicated construction of diffuser pumps, however, is generally not considered justified except occasionally in the case of large high pressure pumps.   Impellers    The impellers used in volute and diffuser pumps are of three kinds, open , semi-open , and enclosed as shown in . The open impeller consists only of blades attached to a hub. The semi-open impeller is constructed with a circular plate, called the web, on the inside edge of the blades. The web need not extend all the way out to the ends of the blades. The use of a web makes it possible to use thinner blades. In the case of the enclosed impeller, a shroud is added on the outside edge of the blades, so that the liquid is in large measure confined in the blade region, between the web and the shroud. Holding the liquid between these plates reduces friction losses in the pump. Open and semi-open impellers are normally found in pumps that must handle relatively large solids in the liquid, such as sewage pumps.  Impellers may also be single or double-suction. The former consists of a single impeller drawing liquid in from one side through one eye, while the double suction impeller is similar to a pair of single suction impellers placed back to back, placing an eye on each side of the impeller so that the liquid is drawn into the impeller from opposite directions. Double suction impellers can handle greater capacities of liquid than a single suction impeller of the same size and operating speed. This is because the larger inlet area of the two suction eyes provides less resistance to liquid flow into the impeller.   Double Suction Pump     Single stage pumps contain only one impeller, drawing in the liquid and expelling it through the discharge into the liquid system. A double-suction, single-stage pump is shown in . A disadvantage of the single-stage pump, however, is that discharge pressure cannot be increased above the maximum working pressure of the impeller design operating at a given speed. Above this limit, under practical working conditions, the pump will not deliver any further increase in pressure. Most volute type, single stage pumps do not operate at speeds in excess of 3600 RPM and typically produce maximum discharge pressures in the 150 to 200 psi range. Diffuser type, single stage pumps may operate at speeds as high as 8000 RPM and produce discharge pressures in excess of 1000 psi; turbine driven boiler feed pumps are sometimes this type.  In multistage pumps , this disadvantage is overcome by combining several single-stage pumps, whether single or double suction, so that the discharge of one impeller is delivered to the suction of the next impeller. The liquid is delivered to each succeeding stage under the pressure imparted to it by the preceding stage, and additional velocity and pressure are added. As the liquid passes through each impeller in turn, additional pressure is imparted to it. A much higher working head can be produced than is possible with a single impeller. For the sake of compactness the several impellers of multistage pumps are almost invariably placed on one shaft, and the whole unit is built into one housing. The impellers are arranged in multistage pumps to eliminate or minimize end thrust.  Both volute and diffuser pumps will be found in single and multi-stage construction. Because of the greater cost and complexity of diffuser pumps, they are rarely used.  The pump itself can have a vertical or horizontal layout, determined by the direction of the pump shaft axis when the pump is installed. Horizontal designs, in most applications, are easier for maintenance personnel to work on, while vertical designs require less floor space for installation. Both designs work equally well.    Centrifugal Pump Principles  The discharge capacity, discharge pressure and horsepower required to drive the pump varies as shown below with changes in impeller speed or impeller diameter .  The discharge capacity Q varies DIRECTLY as the impeller speed or impeller diameter .   The discharge pressure from the AS THE SQUARE of the impeller rpm or diameter.   The horsepower necessary to drive the pump varies AS THE CUBE of the impeller rpm or diameter.     Operations  The following steps describe the procedure for safely starting a centrifugal pump.   Centrifugal Pump Starting Procedure   Rotate the pump by hand to insure it is free to turn.  If the pump has a packed shaft and is to operate with a high vacuum on the suction side, open the seal water line to the stuffing box (if fitted with a valve), and the suction vent line to remove vapors from the suction casing. On a high speed boiler feed pump, open the recirculating line.  Open the suction valve and close the discharge valve.  Prime or flood the pump casing with liquid.  Start the pump prime mover.  As the pump comes up to running speed, briefly open the casing vent valve (if installed) to expel any air from the casing.  When the pump is up to its normal running speed, open the discharge valve.  Check the suction and discharge pressure gages to insure the pump is operating normally and make sure a packed pump shaft has a small amount of liquid leakage.  After the pump has run for a little while, check the casing, stuffing box area (on a packed pump), and the bearing housings for excessive temperatures.     "

  "title": "Reciprocating Pumps",
  "body": " Reciprocating Pumps  In reciprocating pumps , a power source drives a piston or plunger back and forth in a cylinder. This action pushes liquid out into the discharge on the discharge stroke, and draws liquid into the cylinder, from the source of supply, on the suction stroke. For each stroke, the same quantity of liquid enters and leaves the cylinder. The fluid flow through the pump is controlled by two check valves, one in the suction line and the other in the discharge line of the pump.   shows a steam driven reciprocating pump. The steam piston (7) is driven up and down by steam, delivering power to the liquid piston, or (69), which pumps the liquid. When the liquid piston (69) is moved down, the area above the piston is on a suction stroke. As the piston moves down in cylinder (72), the increase in cylinder volume causes a decrease in cylinder pressure. When the pressure in the cylinder drops below atmospheric pressure (creating a vacuum in the cylinder), the atmospheric pressure on the liquid in the suction tank forces the liquid up the suction pipe, through suction valve (85) and into the cylinder. Atmospheric pressure plus the liquid pressure in the discharge pipe create a pressure higher than the pressure in the cylinder. This holds the discharge valve (84) closed. When the piston begins to move up on the discharge stroke, a decrease in cylinder volume occurs, attempting to compress the liquid. This results in an increase in liquid pressure in the cylinder. As soon as the cylinder pressure exceeds the pressure in the suction pipe, the suction valve (85) is forced closed. As the piston continues to move up, the liquid pressure in the cylinder continues to rise. When the liquid pressure in the cylinder exceeds the pressure in the discharge pipe, the discharge valve (84) opens and fluid flows from the cylinder into the discharge line. This process repeated many times can build up a considerable discharge head (pressure) on the discharge side of the pump.   Simplex Reciprocating Pump    Reciprocating pumps are classified as positive displacement, self-priming and most are constant delivery, except for some specialized hydraulic pumps. Reciprocating pumps are additionally classified by the characteristics in    Reciprocating Pump Terminology    Bore  The bore is the inside diameter (ID) of the cylinder, usually measured in inches.    Stroke  The stroke of a pump is the maximum distance the piston can travel from one end of the cylinder to the other, usually measured in inches.    Single stroke  The motion of the piston from one extreme to the other.    Double stroke  The motion of the piston from one end of the cylinder to the other and back to its original starting point. It is equal in distance to two single strokes. It is also a complete operating cycle for that piston (piston has returned to its original starting point and now the cycle repeats.)

  "title": "Rotary Pumps",
  "body": " Rotary Pumps  All the many varieties of rotary pumps operate on the same principle. An element called the is rotated in the pump chamber in such a way that the liquid is carried or pushed from the suction side of the pump to the discharge side.  Rotary pumps are positive displacement, since they deliver a fixed quantity of liquid for each operational cycle or revolution of the pump shaft. This means that they want to move liquid even when the pump discharge is blocked. If the discharge of a rotary pump were closed with the pump operating, and if no pressure relief valve was installed in the pump discharge line, pressure would build up till the shaft seal failed, the electric motor overloaded and stopped, the engine driving the pump stalled, the pump casing or discharge piping ruptured, or some other casualty resulted.  When a rotary pump is operating at a constant speed, the amount of liquid delivered to the discharge line decreases slightly as the discharge pressure working against the pump increases. The drop in discharge capacity is due to increased internal leakage through the close clearances between stationary and moving parts in the pump housing. As the discharge pressure increases, the leakage rate from the discharge to the suction side of the pump, through the internal clearances, increases. This internal leakage reduces the pump’s discharge capacity, and is known as  There are dozens of designs for the rotors of rotary pumps. Gears may be used as in , but with almost any number of teeth, and in a variety of forms; elements that look like gears may be employed, although one of the pair may not be capable of rotating the other; two, three, or more lobes may be used; screws may be used which carry the liquid through the pump in their hollowed-out channels; sliding or swinging vanes may be used which form a seal with the walls of the chamber because they are pushed from the center of the rotor by mechanical arrangements or are thrown out by centrifugal force; small pistons moving in and out from the center of the rotor may be used to push liquid through the pump; and there are still more varieties. A few representative designs of rotary pumps will be described in the following sections.   Gear Pumps   Gear Pump     Gear pumps are probably the most common type of rotary pump, and illustrates a typical example. The liquid is carried from the suction to the discharge in the spaces between the gear teeth and the surface of the pump casing as the gears rotate. One of the gears is directly driven by the source of power, while the other, called the rotates with it in the opposite direction. This is accomplished either because motion is imparted from the drive gear to the idler gear by the meshing of the two gears at the center of the pump chamber, or because outside the pump chamber transmit motion from one gear shaft to the other.  There are close clearances between the gear teeth and the pump casing, and between the teeth of the two gears at their point of contact where they form a continuous fluid-tight joint. As the gears rotate in the direction indicated by the arrows, liquid is trapped in turn between each pair of teeth and the casing and carried away from the suction side of the pump. At the same time, as the teeth un-mesh at the center of the pump chamber, a low pressure is left in the empty space between the gear teeth. Liquid flows in to fill the low pressure areas between the gear teeth. As the gear teeth re-mesh on the discharge side of the pump, the liquid in between the gear teeth is forced out, eventually flowing to the discharge connection on the pump casing.  Three kinds of true gears are used: spur , helical and herringbone . Spur and helical gear pumps can be rotated in the opposite direction to reverse the flow through the pump while generally that is not possible with the herringbone design. When the latter is rotated in the wrong direction, liquid is trapped in the middle of the V resulting in pressure strains on the shafts and bearings.  The herringbone gear pump utilizes gears with a very steep V shape to the gear teeth. These designs are employed when very smooth discharge is desired. The steep angle on the gear teeth, however; prevents the gear driven by an outside source from turning the idler gear. The steep angle causes the gear teeth to jam together rather than rotate freely. Rotary motion is transmitted to the idler shaft via a set of timing gears instead. The timing gears prevent driving contact between pumping gears to eliminate the jamming problem.    Internal Gear Pumps   Internal Gear Pump    In an internal gear system, the teeth of one gear project outwards , but the teeth of the other gear project inwards toward the center of the gear as shown in . One gear stands inside the other in the internal gear pump. A gear directly attached to the drive shaft of the pump is set off-center in a circular chamber fitted around its circumference with the spurs of an internal gear. The two gears mesh on one side of the pump chamber, between the suction and discharge. On the opposite side of the chamber a crescent shaped form (a stationary part of the pump) stands in the space between the two gears in such a way as to provide a close clearance with them.  The rotation of the central gear by the shaft causes the outside gear to rotate, since the two are in mesh. Everything in the chamber rotates except the crescent, causing the liquid to be trapped in the gear spaces as they pass the crescent. This liquid is carried from the suction to the discharge, where it is forced out of the pump by the re-meshing of the gear teeth. As liquid is carried away from the suction side of the pump, the pressure is lowered and more liquid is drawn in.  The direction of flow through this type of pump can be reversed by rotating the crescent (and the pump cover it is attached to) 180 degrees.    Gerotor pumps   Gerotor Pump    The gerotor mechanism consists of pair of gear shaped elements, one within the other, mounted in a pump chamber, see . The inner gear is directly connected to the drive shaft and the source of power, and drives the outer gear through direct contact. The inner gear has one fewer teeth than the outer gear. The tooth form of each gear is related to that of the other in such a way that each tooth of the inner gear is always in sliding contact with the surface of the outer gear. Each meshing pair of teeth only fully engages at one point, 12 o’clock in the figure above.  On one side of the point of mesh, pockets of increasing size are formed as the gears rotate (suction pockets), while the pockets on the other side decrease in size (discharge pockets).    Screw Pumps   Screw Pump    Most screw pumps consist of two to four intermeshing screws rotating in a closely fitted chamber. Liquid, trapped in the channels between the intermeshing screws, is pushed to the pump discharge as the thread of one screw rotates onto the channel of another screw. One screw, generally called the , is driven by an outside power source. The other screws, generally called , have their shafts turned by timing gears or by direct contact between the intermeshing screw threads.    Lobe Pumps   Lobe Pump     Lobe pumps operate on the same principle as gear pumps. There are two rotors turning in the pump chamber operating through timing gears on the shafts outside the pump chamber. Most rotors are fitted with two to three lobes (similar to large gear teeth) to push fluid from the suction to the discharge side of the pump. Although the design will handle both liquids or gases, they are more commonly found pumping gases. A common application is an air pump to supply or increase the air flow to diesel and gasoline engines as part of the system necessary to make them run or increase the horsepower of the engine. In most cases they are considered high volume, low pressure pumps.    Vane Pumps  In vane pumps , the rotor is fitted with a number of slots into which movable vanes are installed. The pump chamber is larger in diameter than the rotor and the rotor is offset in the pump chamber so that they almost come in contact with each other at the 12 o’clock position and are separated by some distance at the 6 o’clock position. As the rotor revolves, the vanes are thrown out by centrifugal force to bear against the inside surface of the pump chamber. (Liquid pressure behind the vanes also pushes them in contact with the chamber wall and sometimes springs are used behind the vanes to force them against the chamber wall) As the rotor turns from the 12 o’clock position to the 6 o’clock position, it moves away from the chamber wall and liquid flows into the space between the moving vanes. From approximately the 5 o’clock to the 7 o’clock position, the liquid is trapped between two vanes, the rotor and the chamber wall and is pushed to the discharge side of the pump. As the rotor revolves back to the 12 o’clock position, the space between the rotor and the chamber wall decreases, forcing the liquid to the discharge connection on the pump casing. Different designs of vanes may be used, as shown in , but the sliding vane type is most common.   Vane Pump     "

  "title": "Principle of Operation",
  "body": " Principle of Operation  An electrical generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy by utilizing the principle of electromagnetic induction . Electromagnetic induction was first discovered in the early 19th century by English scientist Michael Faraday (1791 1867). According to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, a moving or changing magnetic field induces an electric voltage in a nearby conductor. If the conductor forms a closed loop, an electric current will flow and electrical power will be transmitted.  An electrical generator consists of two main mechanical components: a rotating part called the rotor and a stationary part called the stator , and two main electrical components: the armature and the field . Both the armature and the field are made of a conducting material, usually copper wire, wound into multi-loop coils called windings . The rotor is connected to a prime mover, such as a steam turbine or a diesel engine which supplies the mechanical energy to the generator.  The field windings are like an electromagnet. When direct current (DC) flows through the field windings, a magnetic field is created similar to the one which surrounds the north and south poles of an ordinary magnet, but adjustable. The strength of the field is controlled by the amount of the field current. The process of supplying electrical current to the field winding is known as excitation .  The armature windings are the part of the generator where the voltage is induced. The armature consists of several individual windings connected in a specific configuration. The end points of the armature windings are called the generator terminals . As long as the generator is spinning, the field will induce a sinusoidal AC voltage into the armature windings. The armature windings deliver power to the terminals and thence to the load circuit.  The induced voltage is proportional to the speed of rotation and also the strength of the magnetic field, therefore the output voltage can be adjusted by controlling the excitation current. The frequency in Hz (cycles\/sec) depends on the speed of rotation and the number of magnetic poles. where   = frequency   = speed   = number of north\/south pole pairs    The induced voltage is typically generated at a fixed frequency, such as 60 Hz in the United States.  In a typical AC synchronous generator, the rotor carries the field windings and the stator carries the armature windings, however the opposite arrangement is also possible. To generate three-phase power, the stator is fitted with three armature windings arranged symmetrically, 120 degrees apart from each other. As the rotor rotates, the rotating magnetic field induces voltages into each stator winding in turn, generating three sine waves of voltage, equally spaced, shown in .    Three-phase AC Voltage    "

  "body": " Description  As discussed in the previous section, the primary components of an AC generator are the armature and the field, one of which is located on the rotor and the other on the stator. However a practical generator requires many other components, including an enclosure, bearings, cooling, lubrication, instrumentation and control, and a method to excite the field.  These components are shown in and and discussed below.  The shaft is supported by two journal bearings (7 and 13), one on the drive end ( DE ) and the other on the non-drive end ( NDE ). Each bearing has its own integral oil sump with sight glass, cooling fins, and an oil ring that circulates the oil to the top of the shaft as it rotates.  The shaft itself supports and carries the rotating components: primarily the main rotor core (9) and the 8-pole main field windings (4), but also a cooling fan (2) and several other components (10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 19) that are required to excite the generator. Excitation systems will be discussed in .  The main field (4) on the rotor is wound to create eight alternating north and south poles. The main stator core (8) surrounds the main rotor (9) and is wound with three main armature windings (3). As the shaft rotates, the rotor’s magnetic field sweeps by the each of the three armature windings in turn, and induces a sinusoidal voltage in each as shown in . The resulting 3-phase AC is directed to the generator terminals (23), and from there connections are made to the main switchboard.    Hyundai HSJ9 Generator      Generator Exploded View      Water cooled Air Cooler  Ventilation Fan  Main Armature Winding  Main Field Windings  End Shield (DE)  Shaft  Bearing (DE)  Main Stator Core  Main Rotor Core  Main Field Terminals  Leads to\/from Rectifier  Exciter Rotor Core  Bearing (NDE)  Rotating Rectifier  Rectifier Cover  Permanent Magnet Rotor  Permanent Magnet Stator  End Shield (NDE)  Exciter Armature Winding  Exciter Field Winding  Exciter Stator Core  Current Transformer  Main Terminal Box    Both the main core and the stator core are made of thin sheets of electrical steel , called laminations , clamped tightly together. The stationary armature windings (3) and the rotating field windings (4) are inserted into slots formed when the laminations were pressed out, and are firmly wedged in to hold them in position.  Electrical steel is a speciality steel used in the cores of electrical machines such as motors, generators, and transformers. It is an iron alloy with silicon (instead of carbon) as the main additive element. Silicon increases the electrical resistivity of iron by a factor of about 5. Electrical steel also has favorable magnetic properties which tend to reduce magnetic hysteresis  an energy loss caused by the repeated magnetization and de magnetization of the core. These properties reduce energy losses in the core by about three times compared to conventional steel,  The laminations are insulated from each other to prevent current from flowing axially along the core. These currents, called eddy currents , are another source of energy loss, so using insulated laminations improves the generator efficiency.  Generators produce lots of heat while they are operating due to unavoidable losses caused by mechanical friction and electrical resistance, and other factors. If this heat is not removed as it is produced, the generator temperature will rise to unacceptable limits, and high temperature is extremely damaging to electrical insulation. Electrical machines are designed to run for 100,000 hours or more when operated at or below their design temperature limit, however for every 10° C rise above this temperature, the thermal life expectancy of the electrical insulation is reduced by half, so generator cooling is critical.  The generator’s cooling system uses the shaft driven internal fan (2) to circulate the air through the machine. This hot air passes over a water-cooled heat exchanger where it is cooled and then recirculated. The cooling water tubes are double walled with slotted plate fins. Water flows through the inner tube and cools the outer tube and the slotted fins. Air flows between the fins and around the outer tubes and so is cooled.  In the case of a tube leak, water will flow between the inner and outer tubes to a leak detector and trigger an alarm. This prevents water from leaking on to the electrical components.  If for some reason the cooling water is not available, an emergency cooling mode is available. In this mode cover plates on the generator are removed to allow the fan to draw cool air from the engine room and discharge the heated air outside the generator.  "

The function of the exciter is to produce the direct current required to energize the main rotor windings, thereby creating a magnetic field.  There are several important differences between the main generator and the exciter. Although both are 3-phase generators, the main generator has a rotating field and a stationary armature while the exciter has a stationary field and a rotating armature. The exciter is much smaller than the main generator; the main generator can generate more than 440 A, while the exciter generates less than 4 A.    Hyundai HSJ9 Excitation System    The 3-phase output of the exciter is directed through the hollow drive shaft to the rotating rectifier mounted on the non-drive end of the shaft. The rectifier is a solid-state electronic device which uses six diodes arranged as shown in to convert the three-phase AC produced by the exciter generator into direct current. From there, DC current travels back through the shaft to excite the rotating main field windings.   3-phase, full-wave rectifier      3 phase AC in      Rotating Diodes      DC out      "

  "body": " Pilot Generator  Just as the exciter generator is needed to supply the field for the main generator, a third generator is needed to supply the field for the exciter. This is the pilot generator .  In other words, the main generator is excited by the exciter, and the exciter is excited by the pilot generator. This process stops here however, because the field of the pilot generator is produced by permanent magnets, not a field winding. For this reason, the pilot generator is alternately called the permanent magnet generator or the PMG .  The pilot generator is shown in . It is located at the end of the shaft outboard of the bearing on the non-drive end of the generator unit . The rotor carries sixteen permanent magnets of alternating polarities bolted to the rotating shaft. The stator is bolted onto the bearing housing and carries 3-phase wye-connected armature windings. The rotating magnets induce a three-phase AC voltage into the stator windings.  The output of the pilot generator is transmitted to the automatic voltage regulator where it is rectified to DC, and then used to excite the stationary exciter field.   Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG)     Permanent Magnet Rotor      PMG Stator      Because the source of the excitation in this generator is from permanent magnets, rather than an electromagnet excited by the output of the main generator, the generator is considered separately excited. The main advantage of separate excitation is that fluctuations in the voltage of the main generator do not affect the excitation supply. Voltage fluctuations can be quickly corrected and the generator output can be maintained within tight tolerances..  "

A simplified block diagram of the components of the Hyundai HDEC2000 AVR used on the training ship is shown in . The primary function is to provide continuous voltage regulation of the generator through excitation current control with a PID ( proportional, integral, derivative ) software control algorithm, but the device also includes function blocks which provide monitoring, alarm, and system protection. Two-way communications are provided through a network interface or via the front panel.   Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR)     Front Panel      Simplified Block Diagram      The three main components of the AVR are the Digital Signal Processor, the Rectifier, and the Power Module. The device uses a combination of hardware and software to perform its functions.  The Digital Signal Processor  (DSP) is a specialized microprocessor designed to process and manipulate digital signals in real time. The DSP software is executable code stored in nonvolatile Flash memory. The DSP executes code and controls hardware to enable the AVR to perform functions such as regulation, measurement, monitoring, protection, and communications.  The DSP accepts both digital and analog inputs, the most important being the generator voltage and current, which are measured using current and potential (voltage) transformers on the generator output, and digitized by an analog to digital converter ( ADC ) in the DSP. Based on these values and the system requirements, the DSP calculates the amount of excitation current required and produces a command signal that is transmitted to the Power Module.  The Rectifier module supplies DC power to the power module. The power source for the module may come from a Permanent Magnet Generator, as done on the training ship, or directly from the main generator terminals if the generator is self-excited. The module uses a three-phase full-wave rectifier, , to convert the supply to a DC voltage.  The Power Module uses pulse width modulation  (PWM) to trigger a set of insulated gate bipolar transistors ( IGBT) that supply the requested excitation current An excitation current signal is transmitted back to the DSP to be used for to PID feedback, and for over-excitation limitation, protection functions and monitoring.

  "body": " Principle of Operation   Propulsion Converters are very large variable frequency drives , electronic devices that take fixed frequency AC from the main switchboard and convert it to the variable voltage and frequency required to drive the propulsion motor at the desired speed.  A basic variable frequency drive has three main components:   The Diode Front End which takes in an AC power supply from the mains and converts it into DC power using a three-phase rectifier.    The DC Capacitor The rectified power is stored in a large capacitor, which acts as a buffer to provide a stable DC voltage to the DC Bus.    The Inverter The inverter is responsible for converting the DC power back into AC power with variable voltage and frequency. This stage utilizes power electronic devices, such as insulated gate bipolar transistors ( IGBTs ), to switch the DC voltage in a controlled manner.  To synthesize the desired AC waveform, the VFD uses a technique called Pulse Width Modulation ( PWM ). PWM involves rapidly switching the IGBTs on and off to create a series of voltage pulses with varying widths. By adjusting the width of these pulses, the VFD can control the effective voltage and frequency of the output AC waveform.       Main Components of a VFD    By regulating the voltage and frequency supplied to the motor, a VFD allows for precise control of motor speed and torque. This enables energy savings, improved motor performance, and enhanced control in various applications, such as industrial machinery, HVAC systems, and electric vehicle drives.    What is Pulse Width Modulation?   Pulse Width Modulation ( PWM ) is a technique used in electronics to control the average value of a signal. PWM works by rapidly turning a signal (usually a square wave) on and off. The overall effect is that the signal appears to have varying average voltage or power, depending on the width of the on or high portion of the signal.  The duty cycle is a parameter of PWM that represents the percentage of time the signal is on or at a high level compared to the period  the time to complete one cycle. It determines the average value of the signal. A duty cycle of 50% means the signal is on for half the time and off for the other half, resulting in an average voltage or power that is halfway between the high and low levels. By changing the duty cycle, the average value of the signal can be controlled. Increasing the duty cycle increases the average value, while decreasing the duty cycle decreases the average value.      PWM requires a control signal that determines the desired average value. This control signal could come from a microcontroller, analog circuit, or other control systems.  The PWM signal is often passed through a low-pass filter. The filter averages out the rapid switching of the signal, resulting in a smoother output signal with the desired average value.    What is an IGBT?   An IGBT ( Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor ) is a power semiconductor device that combines the characteristics of a MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) and a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). IGBTs are known for their high voltage and current handling capabilities, low conduction losses, and fast switching speeds. IGBTs can rapidly switch on and off in the range of microseconds to a few tens of nanoseconds. They are widely used in high-power electronic applications, such as motor drives, power converters, and inverters.     The operation of an IGBT involves three main states:   Off State When no voltage is applied to the gate, the IGBT is in an off state, and only a small leakage current flows from the collector to the emitter. It behaves like an open switch or closed valve.   On State When full voltage is applied to the gate with respect to the emitter, current freely flows from the collector to the emitter. This is the on state of the IGBT, and it can conduct high currents like a closed switch.   Control State The IGBT can be controlled by applying a variable voltage to the gate. When a positive voltage is applied, it turns on the IGBT, allowing current flow. By adjusting the gate voltage, the IGBT can regulate the current flow.   "

  "title": "Principle of Operation",
  "body": " Principle of Operation  A three-phase induction motor is a type of electric motor that operates based on the principles of electromagnetic induction.    Three-phases Induction Motor    The stator carries three identical sets of phase windings placed 120 degrees apart in a symmetrical pattern and connected in wye.. The specific pattern of the windings determines the number of magnetic poles. Small motors typically have two or four poles per phase, but the ship’s propulsion motors have ten poles per phase.   Stator Windings     Partially Wound      Complete      When three-phase AC power is applied to the stator windings, a rotating magnetic field develops rotating at the synchronous speed .  The synchronous speed is determined by the frequency of the power supply and the number of motor poles. Where:   is the synchronous speed in revolutions per minute (RPM).   is the frequency of the power supply in hertz (Hz).   is the number of magnetic poles per phase.    Synchronous speed represents the speed the motor will spin under no load conditions.  The rotor is typically made of a laminated iron core with conductive bars embedded within it. The bars are shorted at the ends, to form closed loop rotor windings .    Rotor Cutaway Diagram    As the rotating magnetic field passes over the rotor windings, it induces a voltage, according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This voltage drives a current through the rotor windings, which, in turn, generates a magnetic field surrounding the rotor windings.  The magnetic field of the rotor interacts with the rotating magnetic field of the stator and magnetic attraction pulls the rotor in the same direction as the rotating magnetic field. As the rotor rotates, it tries to catch up with the rotating magnetic field.  However, the mechanical load on the motor retards the shaft, so the rotor speed , always remains slightly less than the synchronous speed, . The difference between the synchronous speed and the actual  operating speed is called slip , often expressed as a percentage of the synchronous speed .  The difference in speed between the rotating magnetic field and the rotor's rotational speed induces the current, torque, and power that drives the load connected to the motor shaft. Slip is required for the motor to generate torque and perform useful work.  The mechanical power produced by a motor can be calculated using the formula: Where:   is the shaft power in Watt (W).   is torque or twisting force generated by the motor, measured in Newton-meters (Nm).   is the angular velocity of the motor in radians per second (rad\/s). Angular velocity is equal to the shaft rpm     In practical applications, mechanical power can also be expressed in other units such as kilowatts (kW), Horsepower (HP), or foot-pounds per minute (ft-lb\/min).  An increase in load on the motor causes the shaft to slow down slightly, which increases both slip and torque. The power output of the motor automatically adjusts to match the requirements of the load.  Although the motor always has some slip, the rotor speed is generally close to the synchronous speed. For a motor with a fixed number of poles, the rotor speed can be changed by changing the frequency of the power supply with a variable speed drive or a frequency converter.  "

The rotor windings are formed by bars and rings embedded together and brazed by an induction heating method to form a squirrel cage.  The rotor is supported with self-lubricated, bushed bearings. There are two jacking oil pumps for the drive end bearings and two jacking oil pumps for the non-drive end bearings, normally with one operating and one in standby.  The motors are fitted with two air-water heat exchangers providing cooled air which is forced through internal cooling openings via four 440V 9.2 kW electric-motor driven fans. This air is then circulated back to the coolers. In the event of fan failure, it is still possible to operate at a reduced speed. In the event of cooling water failure, the motor is provided with emergency air openings in the cooler hood and in the stator housing which can be removed for natural cooling.

  "title": "Basic Steam Cycle",
  "body": " Basic Steam Cycle    shows a very simplified version of the steam cycle, which is an appropriate starting point for our discussion of ship’s propulsion.  The steam cycle is an example of what is known by engineers as a cyclic heat engine . It is called cyclic , because it operates on a cycle. It uses a working fluid, water, which travels from point to point through the cycle, changing form and carrying energy, but eventually returning to the starting point restored to the same state that it started with. It is called a heat engine , because it transforms heat , which is a form of energy, into work , another form of energy. The thermodynamic name for this cycle is the Rankine Cycle .  The steam cycle consists of four stages  generation  expansion  condensation  recovery     Simplified Steam Cycle    Since this is a cycle, it has no beginning or end, but we have to start somewhere, so let’s begin with the generation stage.    Generation  Steam generation occurs in the boiler. The boiler is simply a device used to boil water. Like a tea-kettle on the stove, it contains liquid water and a heat source. As the water is heated, its temperature rises and soon it begins to boil. On the stove, the water vapor or steam rises and dissipates into the kitchen, but not so in a boiler. The boiler is a closed vessel, like a pot with a lid, and any steam generated in the boiler rises to the top and is collected before being sent on to the next step of the cycle.  In the generation stage, the chemical energy stored in the ship’s fuel is released when the fuel is burned in the boiler furnace, and some of this energy is transferred to the working fluid – the water. The water gains energy, and we can detect this in two ways: the water’s temperature goes up, and the water changes state from a liquid into water vapor, which we call steam. Steam leaves the boiler at high pressure and high temperature.  As we will learn in , heat energy which raises the temperature of a substance such as water or steam is sometimes called sensible heat while the heat energy that actually boils the substance is called latent heat .  You probably remember that water boils at 212 °F at standard atmospheric pressure (14.7 psia). If you put a thermometer into a pan of water boiling on the stove, this is what it will read. Even if you turn the flame up to add more heat energy, you won’t be able to make the water temperature rise above 212 °F. This is because you are adding latent heat, which is not reflected by an increase in the water’s temperature. All of the heat energy is being used to turn the liquid water into a vapor.  The boiling or condensing temperature of a liquid is known as its saturation temperature . The saturation temperature for a particular liquid is determined by its pressure, and cannot be changed. For example, 212 °F is the saturation temperature for water at atmospheric pressure, and there is nothing anybody can do to change it.  In order to reach high steam temperatures, which is necessary for high steam cycle efficiency, the boiler must be operated at a pressure far above atmospheric pressure. A typical marine boiler operates at about 600 psi while some have operated as high as 1200 psi, although this introduces additional maintenance difficulties. Shoreside steam power plants operate at 3000 psi or even higher.  Steam temperature is raised even further by superheating the steam. Superheating steam raises its temperature above the saturation temperature for the corresponding steam pressure by continuing to add heat to the steam after it has completely vaporized. This must take place in a separate area, called the superheater, away from liquid water, or the additional heat would simply boil more water rather than superheating the steam. Superheated steam is said to be dry , which means that all liquid water has vaporized and it contains no moisture droplets. Drops of liquid water would damage the turbine in the expansion step described below.  Improving efficiency is a major concern of mechanical and marine engineers. High efficiency means that fuel is not wasted, and operating costs are minimized. Practical boiler designs incorporate many techniques to maximize efficiency. For example, not all of the chemical energy originally contained by the fuel ends up transferred to the steam. A large portion of this energy is lost up the smokestack, carried away by the combustion gases. Practical boilers usually contain some sort of heat exchanger in the smokestack in an effort to recover some of this energy.    Expansion  The thermal energy added to the working fluid in the generation stage is converted to mechanical energy, or work, in the expansion stage. This work is produced in the form of a rotating turbine shaft which drives the propeller and moves the ship through the water. The more energy we can remove at this stage, the higher the efficiency of the steam cycle. Unfortunately, it is not possible to remove all the energy from the steam in the turbine. Some energy remains in the steam and is carried to the next stage of the cycle.  A turbine is the device used to accomplish the energy transformation in the expansion stage. Like a pinwheel or a fan, a turbine has a freely rotating shaft with many carefully designed turbine blades attached. However, unlike a fan, the turbine rotor is completely enclosed in a casing which also contains nozzles and stationary blades designed to direct the steam towards the rotating blades .   Turbine Blades   Intro to Steam book    High-pressure, high-temperature steam passes through the nozzle, which has a very small opening, and it emerges with a high velocity. The thermal energy of the steam is converted into mechanical kinetic energy in the nozzle. This high velocity steam jet hits the blades and imparts a turning torque to the rotor shaft and converts its kinetic energy to rotational kinetic energy of the shaft. Most turbines have several rows of blades, forming multiple stages to extract the maximum energy from the steam. As the steam gives up its thermal energy, its temperature and pressure both drop. The steam leaves the turbine at a low temperature and low pressure.  High steam pressure at the inlet to the turbine is important for energy conversion, but it is equally important to have a low pressure at the turbine outlet. Steam, or any fluid for that matter, will only flow from high pressure to lower pressure. Without a pressure drop across the blades of the turbine, there would be no steam flow, and no energy conversion. To maximize the energy conversion, we must also maximize the pressure drop across the turbine.    Condensation  As stated previously, a large pressure drop across the turbine is required to get maximum energy extraction from the steam. The boiler supplies the high pressure at the inlet to the turbine, it is the job of the condenser to create a low pressure condition at the turbine outlet.  The condenser is a shell-and-tube heat exchanger cooled by seawater. It consists of a large, rectangular or cylindrical sealed shell containing thousands of tubes. A circulating pump forces cold seawater in at one end, through the tubes, and it exits overboard at the other end. Steam exiting from the turbine enters the condenser at the top, condenses on the tube surfaces and drains out the bottom. That is, the steam gives up its latent heat of condensation to the seawater, and returns to the liquid water state. Once the steam passes across the condenser tubes, it is no longer steam. It has condensed to liquid water, and from this point in the cycle is referred to as condensate . Condensate leaves the condenser as a low temperature, low pressure liquid.  Because the condensation is occurring at approximately the temperature of the seawater, the pressure in the condenser will be approximately equal to the saturation pressure of steam at this temperature, assuming that no air or other gases are present. For example, if the seawater temperature is 80 °F, the corresponding saturation pressure would be 0.5073 psia. This is a very high vacuum, and the greater the vacuum, the better the plant efficiency.  The latent heat removed from the steam by the seawater raises the temperature and increases the energy contained by the seawater, and this cooling water is discharged overboard.  It is unfortunate that some of the energy once contained by the fuel, and then passed on to the steam in the boiler, is eventually thrown away with the seawater. Wouldn’t it be better to somehow use this energy to power the ship? Absolutely, but there is nothing we can do about it! The only way to extract more energy from the steam is by having the turbine discharge to an even lower absolute pressure than we do. The only way to do that is to condense the steam at even lower temperatures than we are. But we can’t do that, because aboard ship there’s nothing colder than the surrounding ocean available to reject the heat to. If we decided not to reject any heat to the ocean at all, the pressure in the condenser would build up to the point where it would equal the steam pressure entering the turbine, and without a pressure drop, the steam would stop flowing altogether. There’s no win, but we’re doing the best we can.    Recovery  The only thing that remains to complete the cycle is to return the condensate to the boiler to be heated up again. Unfortunately, the condensate leaving the condenser is at a low pressure and the boiler operates at a much higher pressure. Condensate won’t flow back into the boiler by itself. A pump is required to raise the pressure and return the condensate to the boiler.  The pump, known as the feed pump , draws condensate from the condenser discharge, raises its pressure slightly above the boiler pressure, and discharges it back into the boiler to restart the cycle. Condensate leaving the feed pump is known as feedwater .  Work is required to drive the feed pump, and this energy reduces the net work produced by the cycle and available to turn the shaft. Fortunately, since water is incompressible it takes much less work to raise its pressure back to the boiler pressure than we get from an equivalent pressure drop across the turbine, and so there is a net positive amount of work produced by the cycle.    T-s diagram  The diagram shown in is an idealized representation of the Rankine Cycle used in the study of thermodynamics, and known as a Temperature-entropy diagram. The heavy dome shaped curve is known as the vapor dome and points under the curve are saturated steam, while points to the left of the curve are liquid water and points to the right of the curve are superheated steam.  Feedwater enters the boiler at point , and is heated by the fuel. Initially, the water temperature rises, until it reaches the saturation temperature for the boiler pressure, point , where the water begins to boil. Additional heat added at this point does not raise the temperature any further until all the liquid water is completely vaporized, point . The heat added between and is the Latent Heat of Vaporization . After the steam has reached point , any additional heat added causes the temperature to rise again, and the steam becomes superheated.   Temperature - Entropy Diagram    Superheated steam leaves the boiler at point and enters the turbine. During the expansion process, the steam pressure and temperature both drop as energy is extracted from the steam. Steam leaves the turbine and enters the condenser at point , which is saturated or wet steam.  In the condenser, heat is removed from the steam and it returns to the liquid state at point . The feed pump raises the water pressure back up to the boiler pressure and the cycle begins again at point . The feed pump causes a small temperature rise in the feedwater as well as a pressure increase.  The area under the curve from to represents the heat energy added in the boiler and the area under the curve from to represents the heat rejected to the ocean. The area inside the curve represents the net work done by the cycle.   "

Not all energy of the fuel is transferred to the water, some remains in the combustion gases and travels up the stack. This energy will be lost to the atmosphere unless it is recovered by economizers or air heaters located in the exhaust path. Any heat energy lost to the atmosphere represents waste and steam cycle inefficiency.   Marine boilers supply the steam required for propulsion, as well as any other steam requirements of the vessel. Marine propulsion boilers are normally fired with heavy fuel oil, or in a few cases today, coal. Marine boilers, while similar to boilers found ashore, are designed to meet the particular requirements of shipboard use. They are designed to be light and compact to fit into small engine rooms, capable of operating under rapidly changing loads when the vessel is maneuvering, and to operate reliably while the vessel is pitching and rolling during a storm.   Typical Marine Boiler    Diesel and gas turbine powered ships are often equipped with smaller auxiliary boilers to supply the steam for quarters and cargo cargo heating, The heat source for auxiliary boilers can be fuel oil, diesel oil, or the waste heat from the main propulsion diesel engine.

A gage glass on the steam drum allows the operator to determine the water level in the boiler. Too little water would be very dangerous, because without water in the boiler the heat of the flames would melt the boiler tubes and destroy the boiler.  Steam is formed in the boiler tubes, and since steam bubbles are less dense than the surrounding liquid water, they float up to the top of the boiler and eventually rise above the surface of the water in the steam drum. If the steam was allowed to build up in the drum, the boiler pressure would quickly rise, and if not relieved by the safety valves, would cause the boiler to explode. The system is designed to remove steam as quickly as it is created, so a properly operated boiler will maintain a constant pressure.   Steam Drum    A steam drum safety valve is located on top of the steam drum to prevent boiler explosions. This valve will open automatically to relieve the steam pressure up the stack if it rises too high.  "

The main steam stop valve is located at the outlet of the superheater, and it is the primary valve used to connect or isolate the boiler from the remainder of the steam cycle.  According to US Coast Guard regulations, boilers are required to have two valve protection , that is, they are required to have two valves in series in all boiler connections. This insures that at least one valve will be functional when the time comes to secure the boiler. The valve which provides this protection is called the bulkhead stop valve .

There are two throttles, the ahead throttle , and the astern throttle . The ahead throttle controls steam to the high pressure turbine and controls the speed of the ship in the ahead (forward) direction. If the ahead throttle is closed, and the astern throttle is opened, steam will be directed to the astern section of the low pressure turbine and the turbine will rotate in the reverse direction.  The ahead and the astern throttles should not be opened at the same time, because this would cause two opposing torques on the low pressure turbine rotor. While this would not necessarily be damaging, it would be a colossal waste of energy. The Astern Guardian Valve is installed in the astern steam line between the astern throttle and the astern turbine to protect against leakage of the astern throttle while the ship is underway.

Two shorter turbine shafts are more advantageous than one large shaft for several reasons, including reduced manufacturing cost and increased flexibility in the arrangement of machinery in the engine room.  The first of these two turbines is known as the high pressure turbine (HP) and the second is the low pressure turbine (LP). A steam line, called the crossover carries steam from the outlet of the HP turbine to the inlet of the LP turbine.

Superheated steam from the throttles enters the HP turbine where its pressure drops and its thermal energy is converted to mechanical energy. The LP turbine follows the HP turbine and continues to extract energy from the steam. The steam enters at a low pressure (a vacuum actually, at low loads) and exits at an even lower pressure into the main condenser. The specific volume of steam at these low pressures is large, which means that the turbine blades and the LP turbine itself are also large. When looking at the two turbines, it is always easy to identify the LP turbine because of its size; eight to ten feet in diameter is not unusual.  The forward end of the LP Turbine rotor contains the Astern Elements . These are two or three rows of blades designed to rotate the shaft in the astern direction. Since there are so few rows of astern blades, the power the turbine is capable of producing in the astern direction is limited.  The HP and LP turbines and the reduction gear together are known as the Main Engine .  "

Cold sea water enters the shell at the inlet water head or water box, flows across the condenser through the tubes, and is discharged overboardThe steam entering the condenser turns back to liquid water when it comes in contact with the cold condenser tubes. The newly formed condensate drains down to the bottom of the condenser, where it collects in the hot well until it is pumped out.  In order to maintain high plant efficiency it is necessary to maintain a good vacuum in the main condenser. This vacuum is formed by the collapse of the steam as it condenses, since the specific volume of water is so much less than the specific volume of steam. A properly operating main condenser operates at 28.5 in Hg vacuum or greater.  Vacuum will be maintained in the condenser as long as the shell of the condenser does not fill up with air or other gases, however vacuum tends to draw air into the condenser through any available leaks, such as those found at the turbine glands where the turbine shafts penetrate the turbine casing. This air must be pumped back out to the atmosphere as fast as it leaks in, or else vacuum will be lost. This is accomplished with a steam driven pump known as the air ejector which takes suction on top of the main condenser and discharges air to the engine room.  Vacuum will also be lost if condensing stops. This could happen if the supply of cooling water through the condenser tubes was interrupted, perhaps due to failure of the main circulating pump, blocked condenser tubes, or if the condensate pump failed which would cause the condenser to fill up with condensate.

In an actual cycle you will find a number of additional items which are installed to increase the efficiency of the steam cycle by adding essentially free energy to the working fluid.  The first new item is the condensate pump , which is a centrifugal pump that takes suction on the condenser hot well and raises the condensate pressure enough to move it on to the DC heater. The condensate pump must pump from a vacuum, which is a difficult job for a pump. It is important to properly vent and seal the pump, or it will not pump well.  "

  "title": "Heat Exchangers",
  "body": " Heat Exchangers  Following the condensate pump, condensate passes through a series of heat exchangers designed recover otherwise lost heat energy and improve the efficiency of the steam cycle.  First the condensate passes through the Air Ejector Condenser . The Air Ejector is a steam powered air pump that removes air that leaks into the condenser. The steam used by the air ejector is condensed here, where it preheats the condensate. Any heat added before the condensate reaches the boiler represents fuel that doesn’t need to be burned, so the cycle efficiency is raised.   Air Ejector and Air Ejector Condenser    Next, the condensate passes through gland exhaust condenser . This unit condenses steam that leaks out of the turbine glands, and simultaneously recovers more energy and recaptures the leakage. This is an example of the way a practical cycle takes every opportunity to recover free energy and increase the overall cycle efficiency  The drain cooler and first stage heater follow, in that order. The first stage heater uses partially expanded steam to pre-heat the condensate. This steam condenses in the first stage heater, but still is quite hot, so the remaining energy is recovered in the drain cooler. The condensed drains are returned to the system so no water is lost.  The first stage heater is an example of regenerative feed heating , a process that improves the overall efficiency of the cycle. In regenerative heating, steam is partially expanded in the turbine to drive the propeller, then bled off at an appropriate temperature where it is used to preheat the condensate. Some shore power plants have four or more stages of regenerative heating.  The flow order through these heat exchangers is always from coolest to hottest. Therefore the air ejector and exhaust condensers come first, followed by the drain cooler, and finally the first stage heater.  "

The DC Heater is the point in the steam cycle where condensate becomes feed water .  The DC heater provides a second stage of regenerative feed heating, which is accomplished by mixing low pressure steam directly with the condensate. In other words, the heat exchange occurs by direct contact , hence the name. The DC Heater is also sometimes called deaerating feed tank , the DFT , the deaerator , as well as the second stage heater . All these names refer to the same piece of equipment.   DC Heater    The DC Heater serves three important functions in the steam cycle:   Heat  The first function of the DC Heater is to heat the feedwater prior to returning it to the boiler. Thermodynamically, it is known as the regenerative second stage heater. Using the exhaust steam from steam powered auxiliaries to heat the DC Heater increases the overall plant efficiency and saves fuel.    Deaerate  The second function of the DC Heater is to remove dissolved gases (oxygen and free carbon dioxide) from the condensate and make-up water used for boiler feed. Removal of oxygen and free carbon dioxide protects piping and pumps, as well as boilers and condensate return lines from these corrosive gases.    Store  Finally the DC Heater acts as a storage location for feedwater. It acts as a surge tank for the system, allowing fluctuations in the amount of water contained in the cycle to occur without upsetting the feed pump and feedwater regulators.   "

The feed check valve is always fitted with a reach rod or other means to permit it to be manually operated from the boiler control station.  The feed check is followed by the feed water regulator which is an automatic, pneumatically actuated regulating valve that responds to changes in boiler drum level and steam demand to automatically maintain a constant water level half-way up the steam drum.

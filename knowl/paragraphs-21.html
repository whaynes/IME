<section class="paragraphs"><h2 class="heading"><span class="title">Periodic Waves.</span></h2> <div class="para">A periodic waveform is a quantity, (voltage, current, power, for example) that varies in a repeating pattern over time.  Standard AC voltage takes the form of a sine wave as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_sine-wave-definitions.html" title="Figure 4.1.6">Figure 4.1.6</a>, although other shapes such as square waves and sawtooth waves are used in electronic circuits.</div> <div class="para">Periodic waveforms are characterized by several key properties that define its behavior and shape:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%;"><img src="external/images/sine-wave-definitions.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

<dfn class="terminology">Amplitude</dfn> (Peak value): The amplitude is the maximum value reached by the waveform during each cycle. It represents the highest positive or negative value from the reference level (usually zero volts).</div> <div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Frequency</dfn> The frequency <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> of a periodic waveform is the number of complete cycles or oscillations that occur in one second. It is measured in Hertz (Hz). Frequency determines how quickly the voltage waveform repeats itself.  Standard electrical voltage in the United States is generated at 60 Hz, while 50 Hz is used in Europe and Japan.</div> <div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Period</dfn> The period <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> of a periodic wave is the time it takes for one complete cycle to occur. It is the reciprocal of frequency (<span class="process-math">\(T = 1 / f\)</span>) and is measured in seconds.</div> <div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Peak-to-Peak Value</dfn> The peak-to-peak value is the difference between the maximum positive and maximum negative values in a waveform. It represents the total range of voltage variation.</div> <div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Root Mean Square (RMS) Voltage</dfn> The <dfn class="terminology"></dfn>root mean square is a mathematical concept used to represent the <em class="emphasis">effective</em> or <em class="emphasis">average</em> value of a varying quantity, such as voltage or current, in an AC waveform. It provides a way to express the magnitude of an AC signal in a manner that is equivalent to the magnitude of a DC value.</div> <div class="para">RMS values, rather than peak or instantaneous values, are used to describe the properties of AC systems.   For example, when you see the voltage rating on a household electrical device (e.g., 120V for North America), it’s the RMS value that’s being specified. Similarly, the current rating (e.g., 15A) refers to the RMS value of the current.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">For a sinusoidal waveform (like the standard AC power supply waveform), the RMS value is approximately <span class="process-math">\(1/\sqrt{2} =  0.707\)</span> times the peak value of the waveform.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{V_{\text{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad V_{\text{peak}} =V_{\text{RMS}}\sqrt{2}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">The RMS value of an AC voltage is the equivalent steady DC voltage that would produce the same amount of power dissipation across a resistor as the AC voltage across the same resistor. In other words, it’s the voltage that gives the same heating effect as the AC voltage. Similarly, the RMS value of an AC current is the equivalent steady DC current that would produce the same power dissipation in a resistor as the AC current through the same resistor.</div> <div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Phase Shift</dfn> Phase shift refers to the time difference between two periodic waveforms. It’s often expressed in degrees and indicates how far one waveform is shifted in time relative to another. A phase shift of 0 degrees means the waveforms are in sync, while a phase shift of 180 degrees means they are completely out of phase.  Recall that capacitors and inductors cause a phase shift between current and voltage.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/images/phase-shift.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

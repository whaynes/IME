<div class="para">The top of the steam drum is fitted with an air cock, which is simply a pipe terminated with two valves. When the valves are open, the boiler steam drum pressure can equalize with the atmosphere. The air cock is opened when the boiler is first lit off. As the steam begins to form, it is allowed to blow out the air cock, expelling any air which has collected in the drum. After the steam pressure has built up to 20â€“30 psi and all air is expelled, the air cock is closed to seal the drum. It remains closed at all times while the boiler is operating, and is not opened again until the boiler is secured. After the fires are extinguished and as the boiler begins to cool down, the air cock must be reopened again at about 50 psi. Otherwise, the condensing steam in the steam drum will create a vacuum there, breaking the seal at the boiler hand-hole gaskets, which are primarily designed to seal against internal, not external, pressure.</div>

<div class="para">Since heat is measured in BTU and work is measured in foot-pounds, how can we compare the amount of energy put in as heat with the amount of energy put out as work? At first glance, asking how much heat equals how much work might seem like asking how many lima beans equals playing baseball. However, the problem is not that difficult, since both heat and work are forms of energy. The formula for converting heat to work is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
1
\text{ BTU} = 778 \text{ ft-lb}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">or, in other words, the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water 1 Â°F is the same as the amount of energy required to lift a 1-pound weight 778 feet against the force of gravity.</div>

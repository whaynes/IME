<div class="para">The ground connection serves several important functions:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Reference Point</dfn> Voltage is always measured relative to a reference point. By defining a specific point as "ground," voltages at other points in the circuit are measured with respect to this reference.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Safety Grounding</dfn> is crucial for safety in electrical systems. In case of a fault or short circuit, excess current can flow to the ground, allowing circuit protection devices like fuses and circuit breakers to quickly interrupt the current flow. This helps prevent electrical fires, shocks, and damage to equipment.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Human Safety</dfn> In the event of a fault that causes a live conductor to come into contact with a conductive surface (like a metal enclosure), the ground connection provides an alternate path for current to flow <em class="emphasis">around</em>, rather than <em class="emphasis">through</em> the victim, reducing the severity of electric shock.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Shielding</dfn> In electronic devices and systems, grounding is used for shielding against electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). Metal enclosures and components can be connected to the ground to create a shield that prevents external electromagnetic signals from interfering with the deviceâ€™s operation.</div></li>

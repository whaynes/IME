<div class="para">The superheater elements are normally filled entirely with steam, not water. Since no boiling occurs there, all the heat transferred to the superheater tubes must be carried away by the steam flowing through the tubes, or else they will quickly overheat and burn out, destroying the boiler. Whenever there is a fire in the boiler and no steam flow leaving the boiler, the superheater vent must be opened manually by the engineer to protect the superheater from overheating.</div>

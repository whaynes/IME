<div class="para">Gate valves are available in different types of stem connections. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Bonnet_Styles_png.html" title="Figure 5.2.7">FigureÂ 5.2.7</a> illustrates three different types.</div>

<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Non-rising stem, inside screw (A)</em>  The stem screws down into the valve gate as the valve is opened. In this type the stem does not rise or fall outside the valve body as the valve is opened or closed, it simply rotates.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Rising stem, inside screw (B)</em> The stem rises outside the valve as the valve is opened, but the stem screw operates inside the body of the valve. When operated, the valve stem in this design rises and rotates.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Rising stem, outside screw and yoke (C)</em>  The stem screw operates at the level of the hand-wheel, so the stem rises independently of the hand-wheel as the valve is opened. The valve stem rises, but does not rotate. Instead of the valve stem rotating, the hand-wheel rotates the yoke bushing pulling the stem straight up. Valve stem threads can be easily cleaned and lubricated in this design.</div>
<div class="para">Outside screw and yoke design is required on gate valves when diameters exceed 3" and pressures exceed 600 psig.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div> <div class="para">Notice that in both type A and B, the stem threads are exposed to the fluids flowing   through the valve. Fluids can eventually corrode the threads and fluids with solids   entrained can cause the threads to bind up and create excessive wear.</div> <div class="para">Valves with rising stems are used when it is important to know by immediate inspection   whether the valve is opened or closed. The outside screw and yoke type easily indicates   valve position due to the stem extending out beyond the center of the valve wheel when   it is open.</div> <div class="para">The non-rising type is the least likely to leak in the packing area and requires less   installation space.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="gatevalves.html#paragraphs-42" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

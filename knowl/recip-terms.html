<dt>Bore</dt>
<dd><div class="para">The bore is the inside diameter (ID) of the cylinder, usually measured in inches.</div></dd>
<dt>Stroke</dt>
<dd><div class="para">The stroke of a pump is the maximum distance the piston can travel from one end of the cylinder to the other, usually measured in inches.</div></dd>
<dt>Single stroke</dt>
<dd><div class="para">The motion of the piston from one extreme to the other.</div></dd>
<dt>Double stroke</dt>
<dd><div class="para">The motion of the piston from one end of the cylinder to the other and back to its original starting point. It is equal in distance to two single strokes. It is also a complete operating cycle for that piston (piston has returned to its original starting point and now the cycle repeats.)</div></dd>
<dt>Single-acting</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A single acting pump uses only one side of the piston to pump liquid. It is normally the side not attached to the piston rod or the connecting rod.</div></dd>
<dt>Double-acting</dt>
<dd><div class="para">A double acting pump is fitted with suction and discharge valves on both sides of the piston, allowing the piston to pump liquid on both strokes of the pump cycle.</div></dd>
<dt>Direct-acting</dt>
<dd><div class="para">The engine used is a steam reciprocating engine. The steam piston is pushed back and forth in the steam cylinder and the rod attached to the steam piston extends into the liquid cylinder and is directly attached to the liquid piston in the reciprocating pump. The engine produces the mechanical motion the reciprocating pistons require, hence; direct-acting.</div></dd>
<dt>Indirect-acting</dt>
<dd><div class="para">The power sources provide rotary motion to this type of reciprocating pump. The rotary motion of the power supply source must be converted to reciprocating motion at the pistons using a mechanical device called a crankshaft.</div></dd>
<dt>Simplex</dt>
<dd><div class="para">Only one liquid cylinder and piston are built into the pump. They may be operated by a steam reciprocating engine or more commonly today from a rotary engine via a crankshaft and connecting rod.</div></dd>
<dt>Duplex</dt>
<dd><div class="para">Two liquid cylinders and pistons are built into a common pump housing. Each cylinder may be operated by its own separate reciprocating engine. (with both engines built into the common housing) More commonly today, they are driven from a rotary engine via a crankshaft and connecting rods.</div></dd>
<dt>Triplex</dt>
<dd><div class="para">Three liquid cylinders and pistons are built into a common pump housing. Normally driven by a rotary engine via a crankshaft and connecting rods. Although direct-acting and indirecting-acting pumps can be built with more than three cylinders, they are not very common.</div></dd>

<div class="para">Using personal protective equipment requires hazard awareness and training on the part of the user. You must be trained to know when personal protective equipment is necessary, what type is necessary, how it is to be worn, and what its limitations are, as well as know its proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal. In addition, you must be aware that the equipment does not eliminate the hazard. If the equipment fails, you can be injured. To reduce the possibility of failure, equipment must be properly fitted, and maintained in a clean and serviceable condition.</div>

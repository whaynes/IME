<dfn class="terminology">Bump caps</dfn> are less obtrusive than hard hats and are designed to provide comfortable, lightweight but they have limited protection against minor head bumps, knocks, and scrapes.  They in environments where there is a risk of hitting the head on objects such as low ceilings, beams, or equipment. They are not meant a substitute for a hard hat because they do not afford protection from high electrical shock, high impact forces, or penetration by falling objects, and they are not OSHA approved, so they can not be used in situations where a hard hat is required.</div>

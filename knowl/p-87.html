<div class="para">There are many different types of marine boilers. Boilers on steam driven ships are considered <em class="emphasis">propulsion boilers</em>, and are designed to meet the large steam demands of the main engines, as well as all the other steam requirements of the vessel. Diesel and gas turbine powered ships are equipped with smaller <em class="emphasis">auxiliary boilers</em> to supply the steam requirements of these vessels. Propulsion boilers are normally fired with heavy fuel oil, or in a few cases today, coal, while the heat source for auxiliary boilers is either fuel oil, diesel oil, or the waste heat from the main propulsion diesel or gas turbine. Marine boilers, while similar to boilers found ashore, are designed to meet the particular requirements of shipboard use. They are designed to be light and compact to fit into small engine rooms, capable of operating under rapidly changing loads when the vessel is maneuvering, and to operate reliably while the vessel is pitching and rolling during a storm.</div>

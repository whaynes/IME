<div class="para">The motors are fitted with two air-water heat exchangers providing cooled air which is forced through internal cooling openings via four 440V 9.2 kW electric-motor driven fans. This air is then circulated back to the coolers. In the event of fan failure, it is still possible to operate at a reduced speed.  In the event of cooling water failure, the motor is provided with emergency air openings in the cooler hood and in the stator housing which can be removed for natural cooling.</div>

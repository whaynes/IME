<div class="sbspanel middle" style="width:44.4444444444444%;"><div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">digital multimeter</dfn> (DMM) is a versatile electronic tool that combines multiple measurement functions in one device. Most digital multimeters can measure AC and DC voltages, AC and DC currents up to a few amps, resistance, and perform continuity tests.  Some meters can additionally measure capacitance, frequency, check diodes, and measure temperatures with an optional thermocouple. A good digital multimeter is a valuable tool for troubleshooting electrical and electronic devices.</div></div>
<div class="sbspanel middle" style="width:44.4444444444444%;"><figure class="figure figure-like"><img src="external/images/digital_multimeter.png" class="contained"><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">4.4.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Digital Multimeter</figcaption></figure></div>
</div></div> <div class="para">When using a DMM, always ensure that the test leads are correctly connected to the meter; the black lead goes in the common (COM) jack, but the red lead position depends on the measurement you intend to make. Next, select the desired measurement mode with a selector switch to configure the DMM’s internal circuitry, and finally connect the test leads to the circuit and make the measurement.   The DMM displays the measured values on a digital screen, showing the numerical value and unit. Some models have auto-ranging, which selects the appropriate measurement range automatically, and data hold functions to freeze the displayed value.</div> <div class="para">To measure voltage you connect the DMM probes to the circuit across two points of interest.  An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) detects the voltage difference between them and converts it into a digital format which is then processed and displayed. When measuring large voltages, a potential divider circuit proportionally reduces the voltage to a suitable lower value.</div> <div class="para">To measure current, the DMM is connected in series with the circuit under test and the voltage drop across a precision internal resistor is measured to determine the current.   However, to use a DMM to measure current you must disconnect and open a portion of the circuit to introduce the meter.  For this reason, DMMs are rarely used for current measurement.</div> <div class="para">Resistance measurement involves applying a stabilized voltage from the meter’s battery to the component being tested and measuring the resulting current. Using the applied voltage and measured current, the DMM calculates the resistance.</div> <div class="para">A continuity test is just a resistance measurement used to determine if two points are electrically connected.  Often the meter will produce an audible “beep” if the resistance is below a threshold value of 50-100 ohms.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="Electric_components_and_instruments.html#paragraphs-26" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<section class="paragraphs"><h2 class="heading"><span class="title">AC Circuits.</span></h2> <div class="para">In AC circuits the power cannot be calculated as easily as DC power for two reasons.  First, the sinusoidal current and voltage are continuously changing, which means that the power is too.  Second, any reactive elements in the circuit shift the current out of phase with the voltage, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_phase_shift.html" title="Figure 4.1.10">FigureÂ 4.1.10</a>.</div> <div class="para">The first issue is solved by using RMS average values for current, voltage and power, however simply applying <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PEI.html" title="Equation 4.1.2">(4.1.2)</a> and multiplying the RMS voltage by the RMS current does not give the correct RMS power because of the second issue, the phase shift between the current and voltage waveforms.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The correct formula for calculating power in a single-phase AC circuit is</div>

\begin{equation}

P \amp =  \text{Real electrical power (RMS, in watts)}\\

</div> <div class="para">The <span class="process-math">\(\cos\theta\)</span> term is called the <dfn class="terminology">power factor</dfn>.

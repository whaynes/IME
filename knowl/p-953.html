<div class="para">The ahead throttle and the astern throttle should not be opened at the same time, because this would cause two opposing torques on the low pressure turbine rotor. While this would not necessarily be damaging, it would be a colossal waste of energy. The <em class="emphasis">Astern Guardian Valve</em> is installed in the astern steam line between the astern throttle and the astern turbine to protect against leakage of the astern throttle while the ship is underway. This valve normally remains closed, and is only opened when the ship is expected to maneuver.</div>

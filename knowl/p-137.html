<div class="para">The discharge pressure of the feed pump plays a critical role in the proper operation of the feedwater regulator system. Naturally, the feed pump discharge pressure must be greater than the steam drum pressure at all times, or the feed water will not be able to flow into the boiler. Also, if the feed pump discharge pressure fluctuates, the regulator system will have a difficult time responding properly, so the feed pump is equipped with a <em class="emphasis">constant pressure governor</em> which maintains a steady discharge pressure at all times, or an <em class="emphasis">excess pressure governor</em>, which maintains a fixed pressure differential above the drum pressure. The watch engineer should keep a close eye on the feed pump discharge pressure, because changes here will quickly lead to problems with the steam drum level. A stand-by feed pump should always be maintained ready to start quickly if the operating pump has problems.</div>

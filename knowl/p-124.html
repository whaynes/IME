<div class="para">The Feedwater leaves the economizer and enters the steam drum via the internal feed pipe. The feed pipe distributes the water evenly along the length of the steam drum. The coolest and densest water flows down through the downcomers, and perhaps some of the waterwall tubes, screen tubes and generating tubes, to the water drum and lower headers. From there the water is distributed to the various tubes and replaces the water which has turned to steam.</div>

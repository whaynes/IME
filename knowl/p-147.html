<dfn class="terminology">Disposable foam plugs</dfn> Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each personâ€™s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better.</div>

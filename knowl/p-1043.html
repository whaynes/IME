<div class="para">Superheated steam from the throttles enters the HP turbine where its pressure drops and its thermal energy is converted to mechanical energy. The LP turbine follows the HP turbine and continues to extract energy from the steam. The steam enters at a low pressure (a vacuum actually, at low loads) and exits at an even lower pressure into the main condenser. The specific volume of steam at these low pressures is large, which means that the turbine blades and the LP turbine itself are also large. When looking at the two turbines, it is always easy to identify the LP turbine because of its size; eight to ten feet in diameter is not unusual.</div>

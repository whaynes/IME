<h0 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h0><div class="para">Over the last 50 years, diesel propulsion has displaced steam propulsion as the dominant method of merchant ship propulsion, mainly because it has higher fuel efficiency, but also because it is easier to automate, requires less maintenance, and can be operated with smaller crews â€“ all factors leading to operating cost reductions. Nevertheless, steam propulsion remains important, if for no other reason than it is the method we use aboard the old training ship <em class="emphasis">TS Kennedy</em>. Also, steam power is used extensively in industry and power generation ashore, and the skills developed by a steam engineer aboard ship find high demand in the shoreside job market.</div>

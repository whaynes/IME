<dfn class="terminology">Class A.</dfn> Class A hard hats and caps are intended for general service and they provide protection against impact hazards and a limited protection against electrical shock. They are used in industries such as construction, manufacturing, mining, and shipbuilding. This is the most suitable hard hat for shipboard use.</div> <div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Class B.</dfn> Class B hard hats are utility service hats which are designed to protect the wearerâ€™s head from impact and penetration by falling or flying objects and from high-voltage shock and burns. They are used extensively by electrical workers.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/pics/ppe/hardhats.jpg" class="contained"></div>

<dfn class="terminology">Class C.</dfn> The safety hat or cap in Class C is designed specifically for lightweight comfort and impact protection and is sometimes known as a bump cap. Class C helmets are used on occasions where there is a possibility of bumping the head against a fixed object and no danger from falling objects or electrical shock. Bump caps can be worn for protection against scalp lacerations from contact with sharp objects. However, they are not substitutes for safety caps/hats because they do not afford protection from high impact forces or penetration by falling objects.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="safety-head-protection.html#paragraphs-18" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

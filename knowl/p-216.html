<div class="para">Notice that both mechanical potential energy and mechanical kinetic energy are stored forms of energy. It is easy to see why we regard mechanical potential energy as being stored, but it is not so easy to see the same thing about mechanical kinetic energy. Part of the trouble comes about because mechanical kinetic energy is often referred to as “the energy of motion,” thus leading to the false conclusion that “energy in transition” is somehow involved. This is not the case, however. Work is the only form of mechanical energy that can be properly considered as energy in transition.</div>

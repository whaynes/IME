<div class="para">In a threaded pipe connection, matching male and female threads are screwed together to create a secure and leak-resistant joint.  Threaded pipe connections are widely used in plumbing systems, natural gas lines, water supply systems, etc. because they are relatively easy to fabricate and assemble; however they are not suitable for high pressure systems, nor for connections that are frequently taken apart.</div>

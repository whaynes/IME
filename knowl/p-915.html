<div class="para">The steam cycle is an example of what is known by engineers as a <dfn class="terminology">cyclic heat engine</dfn>. It is called <em class="emphasis">cyclic</em>, because it operates on a cycle. It uses a working fluid, water, which travels from point to point through the cycle, changing form and carrying energy, but eventually returning to the starting point restored to the same state that it started with. It is called a <em class="emphasis">heat engine</em>, because it transforms <em class="emphasis">heat</em>, which is a form of energy, into <em class="emphasis">work</em>, another form of energy. The thermodynamic name for this cycle is the <dfn class="terminology">Rankine Cycle</dfn>.</div>

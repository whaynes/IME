<div class="para">Several fuel oil burners are located on the front of the boiler to deliver fuel and air to the boiler furnace in the proper mixture to obtain optimum combustion. The burner assembly, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/register_png.html" title="Figure 1.3.4">FigureÂ 1.3.4</a>, consists of two main parts, the <em class="emphasis">fuel oil atomizer</em> assembly, which breaks up the fuel oil into a fine mist and sprays it into the furnace, and the <em class="emphasis">air register</em> assembly, which directs the air flow into the furnace to insure good air/fuel mixture for complete combustion. The burner may also include a peephole or a flame scanner to monitor the status of the flame, a torch hole for lighting the flame, and/or an igniter so that the burner can be lit off automatically as required by the combustion control system.</div>

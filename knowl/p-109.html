<div class="para">The steps of the LOTO process are:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Identify the equipment or machinery that needs maintenance or repair.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Inform all affected personell that a LOTO procedure will be performed on the identified equipment.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Shut down the equipment using the appropriate procedures outlined in the manufacturer’s instructions or company protocols.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Physically isolate the equipment from its energy sources. This might involve locking out switches, valves, or other control mechanisms. In some cases, this can involve disconnecting power sources, bleeding fluids, or other actions to ensure there’s no energy flowing to the equipment.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Place a lock on the energy-isolating device to prevent it from being operated. A tag is also attached to the lock indicating who performed the lockout and why. This helps communicate that the equipment is being worked on and should not be operated.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Ensure that any residual or stored energy in the equipment is safely released. This might involve releasing pressure, tension, or any other forms of stored energy.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Verify that the equipment is truly isolated by attempting to start or activate it. This step is important to confirm that the energy sources have been effectively disconnected.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Perform the necessary maintenance, repairs, or servicing on the equipment while it is in the locked and tagged state.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Once the maintenance or servicing is complete, the person who performed the LOTO procedure removes the locks and tags, and the equipment is ready to be safely restarted.</div></li>

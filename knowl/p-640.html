<dfn class="terminology">Clamp-on ammeters</dfn> are hand-held instruments used to measure AC currents. A plier-like pick-up coil is closed around the conductor in which current is to be measured, and the movement responds to current induced in the pick-up coil by the changing magnetic field surrounding the conductor.  Clamp-on meters are preferable to digital multimeters for measuring currents because the donâ€™t require the circuit to be disturbed to use, and they can measure larger currents than a DMM, however, because they depend on a changing magnetic field they do not work with DC currents.</div>

<div class="para">Inside the steam drum you will find several internal fittings. These fittings help distribute water evenly throughout the drum, separate the generated steam from the water, and remove moisture from the steam before it leaves the boiler. The <em class="emphasis">dry pipe</em> is a perforated tube located at the top of the steam drum. As steam is formed and rises to the top of the boiler, it enters the dry pipe and from there it is removed from the steam drum. It is important that no moisture enter the dry pipe, because water droplets in the steam would damage the turbines downstream, so modern boilers include <em class="emphasis">cyclone steam separators</em> which help to remove moisture from the steam by causing it to spin rapidly around a spiral path as it moves upward. The centrifugal force throws the heavier water droplets to the separator walls, where it drains back to the drum. Only dry steam should make it through the separator. A <em class="emphasis">chemical feed pipe</em> is provided to distribute boiler chemicals throughout the steam drum. Another perforated pipe known as the <em class="emphasis">internal feed pipe</em> is located below the water level and is used to distribute the incoming feedwater evenly throughout the steam drum. The <em class="emphasis">surface blow pipe</em> is another perforated pipe located below the water level and connected overboard. Opening the <em class="emphasis">surface blow valve</em> allows boiler water to discharge over the side. This is done to rid the boiler of contaminants such as suspended solids, oil and excess boiler chemicals, and in emergencies to lower the boiler water level quickly.</div>

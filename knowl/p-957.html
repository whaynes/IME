<div class="para">The L.P. turbine follows the H.P. turbine and continues to extract energy from the steam. The steam enters at a low pressure (a vacuum actually, at low loads) and exits at an even lower pressure into the main condenser. The specific volume of steam at these low pressures is large, which means that the turbine blades and the L.P. turbine itself are also large. When looking at the two turbines, it is always easy to identify the L.P. turbine because of its size; eight to ten feet in diameter is not unusual.</div>

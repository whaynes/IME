<div class="para">Feedwater enters the boiler at point <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> and is heated by the fuel. Initially, the water temperature rises, until it reaches the saturation temperature for the boiler pressure, point <span class="process-math">\(1_f\text{,}\)</span> where the water begins to boil. Additional heat added at this point does not raise the temperature any further until all the liquid water is completely vaporized, point <span class="process-math">\(1_g\text{.}\)</span> The heat added between <span class="process-math">\(1_f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1_g\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">Latent Heat of Vaporization</dfn>. After the steam has reached point <span class="process-math">\(1_g\text{,}\)</span> any additional heat added causes the temperature to rise again, and the steam becomes superheated.</div>

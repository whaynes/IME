<div class="para">Since the chemical reaction of the combustion process is understood, and we know that air contains about 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen, we can calculate precisely how many pounds of air are required to burn each pound of fuel completely. If the combustion control system admitted exactly this much air however, the combustion would still be incomplete, because we can’t insure perfect mixing of all the air with the fuel. Some of the available oxygen would never reach the unburned fuel droplets. To avoid this problem, a properly operated boiler always provides some <em class="emphasis">excess air</em> beyond the amount theoretically required, to insure complete combustion. Too much excess air will cause unnecessary heat loss up the smokestack, reducing the boiler’s efficiency.</div>

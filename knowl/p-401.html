<div class="para">Sadly, electron current is not technically <dfn class="terminology">current</dfn>! This is because, in 1752, before the nature of electric charge and electrons was fully understood,  Benjamin Franklin <em class="emphasis">defined</em> current as a stream of charge that flows from a more positively charged area to a more negatively charged area (less positive). That is, the direction of current is defined exactly opposite to the electron flow. This convention was adopted because it is easier to think of a flow going from a higher level (more positive) to a lower level (less positive), like water flowing down hill.</div>

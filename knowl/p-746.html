<div class="para">The training ship has two high voltage main switchboards (HVMSB);  Switchboard one is located in the forward engine room, and switchboard two is the after engine room.  Each switchboard is divided into two connected buses:  Switchboard one contains buses one and two, switchboard two contains buses three and four.  The buses are interconnected with circuit breakers to permit the power to be re-routed in an emergency.</div>

<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/recip_pump_png.html" title="Figure 4.3.7">FigureÂ 4.3.7</a> shows a steam driven reciprocating pump. The steam piston (7) is driven up and down by steam, delivering power to the liquid piston, or (69), which pumps the liquid. When the liquid piston (69) is moved down, the area above the piston is on a suction stroke. As the piston moves down in cylinder (72), the increase in cylinder volume causes a decrease in cylinder pressure. When the pressure in the cylinder drops below atmospheric pressure (creating a vacuum in the cylinder), the atmospheric pressure on the liquid in the suction tank forces the liquid up the suction pipe, through suction valve (85) and into the cylinder. Atmospheric pressure plus the liquid pressure in the discharge pipe create a pressure higher than the pressure in the cylinder. This holds the discharge valve (84) closed. When the piston begins to move up on the discharge stroke, a decrease in cylinder volume occurs, attempting to compress the liquid. This results in an increase in liquid pressure in the cylinder. As soon as the cylinder pressure exceeds the pressure in the suction pipe, the suction valve (85) is forced closed. As the piston continues to move up, the liquid pressure in the cylinder continues to rise. When the liquid pressure in the cylinder exceeds the pressure in the discharge pipe, the discharge valve (84) opens and fluid flows from the cylinder into the discharge line. This process repeated many times can build up a considerable discharge head (pressure) on the discharge side of the pump.</div>

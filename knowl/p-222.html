<div class="para">As you can see from this formula, you need to know how much force is exerted and the distance through which the force acts before you can find how much work is done. The unit of force is the pound. When work is done against gravity, the force required to move an object is equal to the weight of the object. Why? Because weight is a measure of the force of gravity or, in other words, a measure of the force of attraction between an object and the earth. How much work will you do if you lift that 5-pound rock from the bottom of the 100-foot cliff to the top? You will do 500 foot-pounds of work-the weight of the object (5 pounds) times the distance (100 feet) that you move it against gravity.</div>

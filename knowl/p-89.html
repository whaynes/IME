<div class="para">A cutaway view of a typical marine boiler is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sg-0008_png.html" title="Figure 1.2.2">FigureÂ 1.2.2</a>. This boiler is described as a <em class="emphasis">water-tube</em>, D-Type, accelerated natural circulation boiler, because its tubes contain the water and steam, not combustion gases; are arranged roughly like the letter <em class="emphasis">D</em>; and because the water circulates through the boiler without a pump, purely due to differences in the density of the water and steam. Early marine boilers, and some auxiliary boilers today are designated <em class="emphasis">fire-tube</em> boilers, because the hot exhaust gases products of combustion pass through the tubes, and the water surrounds the tubes. Other boiler designs and auxiliary boilers will be discussed in more detail in later courses at MMA, either <em class="emphasis">Steam Generators</em> for marine engineers, or <em class="emphasis">Commercial Boilers</em> for facilities engineers.</div>

<div class="para">You may also find a <em class="emphasis">submerged tube desuperheater</em> in the steam drum. This is a pipe which makes several passes underneath the surface of the water in the steam drum. Superheated steam is passed through this pipe, where it cools down to near its saturation temperature. Internal desuperheaters like this are used for two purposes. Most commonly, they are used to provide desuperheated steam for auxiliary systems which are not designed to operate on high temperature superheated steam. Other desuperheaters are used to reduce and control the temperature of the main superheated steam by blending the hot superheated steam with cooler desuperheated steam; this type is called a <em class="emphasis">control desuperheater.</em>

<div class="para">A <em class="emphasis">steam drum safety valve</em> is also located on top of the steam drum. This valve is adjusted to open automatically if the steam drum pressure rises too high. This can protect the boiler from exploding, and the noise of the steam flowing through should alert the engineer that something is seriously wrong. If you ever hear a boiler safety valve blowing off steam, your first action as an engineer should be to secure the fires, to prevent additional steam from being generated, until you know what is causing the problem.</div>

<div class="para">When operating, the boiler water level is subject to <em class="emphasis">shrink and swell</em>. The specific volume of steam is dependent on the pressure of the surroundings; lower pressure steam takes up more space. When the main engine throttles are opened, the boiler pressure temporarily drops as the steam rushes to the turbine. This drop in pressure causes the steam bubbles remaining in the generating tubes to expand, forcing the water level in the drum to rise or <em class="emphasis">swell</em>. When the throttles are closed the reverse happens; the boiler pressure increases quickly, and compresses the steam bubbles, causing the water level to <em class="emphasis">shrink</em>. A properly adjusted two-element feed water regulator will respond properly to shrink and swell. For example, during swell conditions the drum level sensor sees high water and asks the regulating valve to close off, while at the same time, the steam flow sensor detects an increase in steam flow, and asks the regulating valve to open more. The two effects cancel each other out, and the regulating valve holds its position, which is the correct response, since the actual mass of water in the boiler really hasnâ€™t changed. Later as the drum pressure recovers, the swell subsides and the steam flow signal remains, causing the regulator to open a bit more. Close observation of the feed water regulator during maneuvering will be valuable if you are ever called upon to regulate the boiler water level manually.</div>

<div class="para">The term press pack refers to the physical packaging of electronic components.  It typically consists of a semiconductor chip,  along with its associated control and protection circuitry, mounted between two metal plates which serve as electrical contacts and provide mechanical support. These plates are made of good thermal conductors such as copper or aluminum. This design allows for efficient heat dissipation, as the metal plates can be directly attached to a heat sink.</div>

<div class="para">A lift check valve has a specially designed disk or ball which closes against a seat just like a typical globe valve. In this design, the disk or ball is not attached to any arm or stem. Since the disk is free to move away from the seat without an arm or stem to guide it back in correct alignment to the seat upon closing, other guidance means are employed. In most lift check valves, the disk (with higher than normal sides) or the ball just fits into to hole in the upper part of the body. When flow pushes the disk or ball away from the seat, the walls of the hole in the upper body guide the disk or ball straight up away from the seat. These walls also guide the disk straight down when it is closing assuring correct alignment between the disk and seat for tight closure.</div>

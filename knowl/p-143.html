<div class="para">One way to monitor the amount of excess air is to watch the color of the smoke produced by the boiler. A properly operated boiler will have a colorless or light exhaust; black smoke indicates insufficient combustion air for the amount of fuel, and white smoke indicates the opposite. The boiler is equipped with a periscope smoke indicator which allows the operator to look through the stack to observe the color of the exhaust gases. The periscope should be checked frequently, and the fuel/air ratio adjusted as necessary to maintain a clear stack with a minimum of excess air. Be aware that a clear stack may still have too much air; try reducing the air until a light haze develops, then increase slightly. Be alert also that heavy white smoke appears black in the periscope because it completely blocks the light.</div>

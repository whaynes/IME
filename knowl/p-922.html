<div class="para">High-pressure, high-temperature steam passes through the nozzle, which has a very small opening, and it emerges with a high velocity. The thermal energy of the steam is converted into mechanical kinetic energy in the nozzle. This high velocity steam jet hits the blades and imparts a turning torque to the rotor shaft and converts its kinetic energy to rotational kinetic energy of the shaft. Most turbines have several rows of blades, forming multiple stages to extract the maximum energy from the steam. As the steam gives up its thermal energy, its temperature and pressure both drop. The steam leaves the turbine at a low temperature and low pressure.</div>

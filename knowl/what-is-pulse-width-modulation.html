<div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Pulse Width Modulation</dfn> (<dfn class="terminology">PWM</dfn>) is a technique used in electronics to control the average value of a signal.  PWM works by rapidly turning a signal (usually a square wave) on and off. The overall effect is that the signal appears to have varying average voltage or power, depending on the width of the <em class="emphasis">on</em> or <em class="emphasis">high</em> portion of the signal.</div>
<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">duty cycle</dfn> is a parameter of PWM that represents the percentage of time the signal is on or at a high level compared to the <dfn class="terminology">period</dfn> â€” the time to complete one cycle. It determines the average value of the signal. A duty cycle of 50% means the signal is on for half the time and off for the other half, resulting in an average voltage or power that is halfway between the high and low levels. By changing the duty cycle, the average value of the signal can be controlled. Increasing the duty cycle increases the average value, while decreasing the duty cycle decreases the average value.</div>

<div class="para">PWM requires a control signal that determines the desired average value. This control signal could come from a microcontroller, analog circuit, or other control systems.</div>
<div class="para">The PWM signal is often passed through a low-pass filter. The filter averages out the rapid switching of the signal, resulting in a smoother output signal with the desired average value.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="VFDs.html#what-is-pulse-width-modulation" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

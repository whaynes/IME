<div class="para">There are dozens of designs for the rotors of rotary pumps. Gears may be used as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gear_pump_png.html" title="Figure 5.3.9">FigureÂ 5.3.9</a>, but with almost any number of teeth, and in a variety of forms; elements that look like gears may be employed, although one of the pair may not be capable of rotating the other; two, three, or more lobes may be used; screws may be used which carry the liquid through the pump in their hollowed-out channels; sliding or swinging vanes may be used which form a seal with the walls of the chamber because they are pushed from the center of the rotor by mechanical arrangements or are thrown out by centrifugal force; small pistons moving in and out from the center of the rotor may be used to push liquid through the pump; and there are still more varieties. A few representative designs of rotary pumps will be described in the following sections.</div>

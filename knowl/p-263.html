<div class="para">The constant <em class="emphasis">g</em> depends on where you are: on earth the constant is greater than it  is on the moon, so you weigh less on the moon than you do on earth. In outer space, the  constant is zero, making you weightless there. Be careful not to confuse weight with mass. The  mass of an object will not change when it moves to another location, but its weight may. One  reason why people often confuse weight with mass is because in the English system and on the  surface of the earth, the gravitational constant <em class="emphasis">g</em> is equal to 1, and so one pound of  mass has a weight of one pound of force. Move to the moon, and the pound of mass now weighs  about six tenths of a pound. On earth in the SI system, <em class="emphasis">g</em> is approximately equal to  9.81 <span class="process-math">\(\textrm{m/s}^2\text{.}\)</span>

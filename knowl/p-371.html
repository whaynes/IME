<div class="para">Although it is impossible to raise the temperature of the steam in the steam drum above the temperature of the water from which it is being generated, we can raise the temperature of the steam if we first remove the steam from contact with the water inside the steam drum and then add heat. Steam which has been heated above its saturation temperature for any given pressure is called <em class="emphasis">superheated steam</em>, and the vessel in which the saturated steam is superheated is called a <em class="emphasis">superheater.</em>The amount by which the temperature of the superheated steam exceeds the temperature of saturated steam at the same pressure is known as the <em class="emphasis">degree of superheat</em>. For example, if saturated steam at a pressure of 620 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature of 490 °F is superheated to 790 °F, the degree of superheat is 300 °F.</div>

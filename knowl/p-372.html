<div class="para">Relief valves are designed to close at a pressure lower than their opening pressure (The difference between opening and closing pressure is called <em class="emphasis">blowdown</em>). This is done to prevent <em class="emphasis">valve chattering</em>, which is a rapid opening and closing of the valve. Chattering is undesirable because it can damage the seat and disk. If the valve opened and closed at exactly the same pressure, it would chatter, because as soon as it opened, the pressure would drop and cause the valve to close, and as soon as it closed the pressure would cause it to open again.</div>

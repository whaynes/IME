<div class="para">Globe valves are used in throttling applications, that is, anytime you want to regulate or control the amount of liquid flowing through a system, you could select a globe valve. A bathroom sink faucet or a garden hose spigot are common examples of globe valves found around the house. In a globe valve, the moving part (called the <em class="emphasis">valve disk</em>) blocks an opening in the valve (called the <em class="emphasis">seat</em>) to shut off flow, and when the valve stem is turned, the disk moves away from the seat – in the path of the fluid flow – as the valve is opened. To close the globe valve, the disk is moved back towards the seat until they touch, seal, and stop the fluid flow through the valve.</div>

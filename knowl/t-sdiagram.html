<div class="para">The diagram shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ts_diagram_fig.html" title="Figure 7.1.3">FigureÂ 7.1.3</a> is an idealized representation of the <dfn class="terminology">Rankine Cycle</dfn> used in the study of thermodynamics, and known as a <dfn class="terminology">temperature-entropy diagram</dfn>. The heavy dome shaped curve is known as the <dfn class="terminology">vapor dome</dfn> and points under the curve are saturated steam, while points to the left of the curve are liquid water and points to the right of the curve are superheated steam.</div>
<div class="para">Feedwater enters the boiler at point <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> and is heated by the fuel. Initially, the water temperature rises, until it reaches the saturation temperature for the boiler pressure, point <span class="process-math">\(1_f\text{,}\)</span> where the water begins to boil. Additional heat added at this point does not raise the temperature any further until all the liquid water is completely vaporized, point <span class="process-math">\(1_g\text{.}\)</span> The heat added between <span class="process-math">\(1_f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1_g\)</span> is the <dfn class="terminology">Latent Heat of Vaporization</dfn>. After the steam has reached point <span class="process-math">\(1_g\text{,}\)</span> any additional heat added causes the temperature to rise again, and the steam becomes superheated.</div>
<div class="para">Superheated steam leaves the boiler at point <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and enters the turbine. During the expansion process, the steam pressure and temperature both drop as energy is extracted from the steam. Steam leaves the turbine and enters the condenser at point <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> which is saturated or wet steam.</div>
<div class="para">In the condenser, heat is removed from the steam and it returns to the liquid state at point <span class="process-math">\(4\text{.}\)</span> The feed pump raises the water pressure back up to the boiler pressure and the cycle begins again at point <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> The feed pump causes a small temperature rise in the feedwater as well as a pressure increase.</div>
<div class="para">The area under the curve from <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> represents the heat energy added in the boiler and the area under the curve from <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> represents the heat rejected to the ocean. The area inside the curve represents the net work done by the cycle.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="simplifiedsteamcycle.html#t-sdiagram" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first letâ€™s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power <span class="process-math">\(P_1\text{,}\)</span> and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power <span class="process-math">\(P_2\text{,}\)</span> but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
10 \log (P_2/P_1) \text{ dB}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where the log is to base 10.</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 2 = 3 \text{ dB}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 10 = 10 \text{ dB}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">B. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 1,000,000 = 60 \text{ dB} \text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size.</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span> The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is just <span class="process-math">\(2 \log x \text{,}\)</span> this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with <span class="process-math">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p_2\)</span> is defined as:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
20 \log (p_2/ p_1) \text{ dB}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where the log is to base 10.</div>
</div>
<div class="para">This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries. So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that <span class="process-math">\(20 \log (p_2/p_1) = 86 \)</span> dB where <span class="process-math">\(p_1\)</span> is the sound pressure of the reference level, and <span class="process-math">\(p_2\)</span> that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: <span class="process-math">\(\log (p_2/p_1) = 4.3 \)</span> dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
= 20 \log (p / p_{ref}) = 20 \log 1 = 0 \text{ dB}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals.</div>

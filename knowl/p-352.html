<div class="para">Another principle, the <em class="emphasis">Principle of Conservation of Matter,</em> states: “Matter can be neither created nor destroyed, but only transformed.” As you probably know, the development of the atomic bomb demonstrated that matter can be converted into energy; other developments have demonstrated that energy can be converted into matter. Therefore, the Principle of the Conservation of Energy and the Principle of the Conservation of Matter are no longer considered as two parts of a single law or principle but are combined into one principle: “Matter and energy are interchangeable, and the total amount of energy and matter in the universe is constant."</div>

<div class="para">If we start with 1 pound of ice at 0 °F, we must add 16 BTU in order to raise the temperature of the ice to 32 °F. We call this adding sensible heat. To change the pound of ice at 32 °F to a pound of water at 32 °F, we must add 144 BTU (the <em class="emphasis">latent heat of fusion</em>). There will be no change in temperature while the ice is melting. After all the ice has melted, however, the temperature of the water will be raised as additional heat is supplied. If we add 180 BTU that is, 1 BTU for each degree of temperature between 32 °F and 212 °F the temperature of the water will be raised to the boiling point. To change the pound of water at 212 °F, to a pound of steam at 212 °F, we must add 970 BTU (the <em class="emphasis">latent heat of vaporization</em>). After all the water has been converted to steam, the addition of more heat will cause an increase in the temperature of the steam. If we add approximately 42 BTU to the pound of steam which is at 212 °F, we can superheat it to 300 °F.</div>

<div class="para">Voltage in an electrical system is equivalent to pressure in a fluid system, and just as a pump generates fluid pressure, voltage must be generated somehow.  There are several methods to produce a voltage, including <em class="emphasis">chemical reactions</em> (such as in batteries) and the <em class="emphasis">photovoltaic effect</em> (as in solar cells); however, the most important method is <dfn class="terminology">electromagnetic induction</dfn>.  Electromagnetic induction is the process where a changing magnetic field induces (creates) an electric voltage in a nearby conductor.   This phenomenon is the basis for generating electricity in devices like generators and transformers and it will be described in more detail in <a href="topic-faradays-law.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 4.1.9: Faraday's Law">SubsectionÂ 4.1.9</a>.</div>

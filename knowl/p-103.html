<div class="para">When water boils, it occurs at a particular temperature which is determined by the pressure of the surroundings. For example, water at atmospheric pressure always boils at 212 °F, while water at 600 psia always boils at 486 °F. This boiling temperature is known as the <em class="emphasis">saturation temperature</em> and it can easily be determined from the steam tables found in . At a given pressure, the steam’s temperature can be raised above the corresponding saturation temperature by adding additional heat to the steam, but this must occur in an area where there is no liquid water present, or the additional heat would simply boil more water and would not raise the steam temperature at all. Raising steam temperature above the saturation temperature is known as <em class="emphasis">superheating</em> and the <em class="emphasis">degree of superheat</em> refers to the difference between the steam temperature and the saturation temperature corresponding to the steam’s pressure. For example, 600 psia, 600 °F steam would have 114 degrees of superheat, since it is 114 degrees above the corresponding saturation temperature.</div>

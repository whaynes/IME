Typically, medium speed diesel engines are coupled with low-speed motors and propellers. The speed reduction is accomplished by selecting the appropriate number of motor poles, and the shaft speed (RPM) is established by adjusting the electrical frequency to the motor. This setup allows each component to operate within its most efficient range, maximizing overall energy efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Electric-propulsion.html#li-170" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

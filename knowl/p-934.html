<div class="para">The discharge passage gradually widens as it leads the liquid away from the impeller to the discharge nozzle on the pump housing. The gradual widening of the discharge passage reduces the velocity of the liquid. Since the reduction in velocity does not produce work, it results in a change in the type of energy contained in the liquid. Most of the velocity (kinetic energy) in the liquid produced by the centrifugal pump is transformed into pressure (potential energy) by the widening discharge passage. This type of energy is more available for doing work. On most centrifugal pumps this widening passage is built into the pump casing that surrounds the impeller and is called the  <dfn class="terminology">volute</dfn>. Additional conversion of velocity to pressure may be accomplished in the <dfn class="terminology">discharge nozzle</dfn> and sometimes in the piping leading away from the pump.</div>

<div class="para">Head can also be thought of as the pressure necessary to support a column of water of a height equal to the head. Since head can be related to pressure, you may be wondering how atmospheric pressure affects the pump. Usually there is no effect at all. Since atmospheric pressure acts on the surface of the liquid in both the suction and discharge tanks, the effect is equal but in opposite directions on each side of the pump, and the result is that the net effect of the atmospheric pressure on the pump, is canceled out.</div>

<div class="para">Length units based on the human body were used for thousands of years. The Roman mile (In Latin <i class="foreign">mille passus</i>, which means “thousand paces”) consisted of a thousand paces (of 5 feet each) as measured by every other step—as in the total distance of the left foot hitting the ground 1,000 times, which equals approximately 5,000 ft. In 1592, English Parliament wanted to standardize the measurement of the mile and made the decision that it should be equal to eight furlongs. Furlongs, which are still used as a unit of measurement in horse racing, are 660 feet long. 660 times eight equals, you guessed it, 5,280 ft.</div>

<div class="para">The boiler tubes connect the steam drum to the water drum, roughly in the shape of a letter “D.” A boiler may contain perhaps 2000 tubes, most of which are considered <em class="emphasis">generating tubes</em>, where the majority of the steam produced by the boiler is formed. As the steam formed in the generating tubes rises up to the steam drum, it must be replaced with cooler water from the steam drum. This water is carried down through tubes located in cooler areas of the boiler, known as <em class="emphasis">downcomers</em>. A typical generating tube would be about 1 to 1½ inch diameter, while the downcomers are larger; 3 to 11 inches in diameter.</div>

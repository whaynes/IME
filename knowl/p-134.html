<div class="para">The boiler is equipped with several means to observe the boiler water level. The simplest is the <em class="emphasis">boiler gage glass</em>. This device is mounted on the steam drum and makes the water level in the drum directly visible in the same way that the glass on the side of a coffee urn works. The glass is mounted such that the normal operating level is in the center of the glass, and as long as the water level is visible in the glass, the boiler is safe, however the operator should never let the level get within two inches of the top or bottom of the gage glass. A visible water level in the gage glass is reassuring, but it may be a false level if the gage glass valves are closed or the lines are blocked. Periodically blowing down the gage glass will insure that it indicates accurately. The <em class="emphasis">remote level indicator</em>, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/waterlevel_png.html" title="Figure 1.3.8">FigureÂ 1.3.8</a>, is a water level sensor connected to a level display that can be mounted in any location, normally wherever convenient for the boiler operator. This device is also called the <em class="emphasis">eye-hi</em> indicator. <em class="emphasis">High and Low Level Alarms</em> are sensors which are used to trigger an alarm when the water reaches a critical level. Usually two sensors are provided, the first gives a warning signal when the level is about six inches above or below the normal water level, the second secures the fires if the level continues to rise or fall after the warning alarm.</div>

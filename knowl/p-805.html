<dfn class="terminology">Compression fittings</dfn> are made up of three basic elements: the <dfn class="terminology">compression nut</dfn> , the <dfn class="terminology">ferrule</dfn> , and the body.  The tubing is slipped through the nut and the ferrule and then inserted into the end of the body.  By tightening the nut/screw the ferrule is forced into the fitting body. As the ferrule  moves axially into the fitting body, the bodyâ€™s angled shape compresses the end of the ferrule onto the outer diameter of the tubing. It is this radial compression that creates a leak tight seal between the fitting, ferrule, and tubing, and gives the compression fitting its name.</div>

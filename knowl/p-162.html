<div class="para">The National Safety Council has found that hands are the body part most frequently injured on the job. Accidents to the hand fall into these categories: abrasions, cuts, punctures, crushes, contact with moving machinery, burns, and chemical injuries. Gloves and hand protection are available to protect you from nearly all of these hazards. However, glove selection must be based on performance characteristics of the gloves, conditions, durations of use, and hazards present. One type of glove will not work in all situations.</div>

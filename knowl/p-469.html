<div class="para">When the switch is closed,  current flowing in the left coil produces a magnetic field surrounding the conductor (Oersted’s principle).  This field is trapped and channeled through the right hand coil by the iron ring.  As the field builds up when the switch is closed, or collapses when the switch is opened, a voltage is detected on the galvanometer (Faraday’s Law).  However, If the switch is left in either position for very long, the voltage decays to zero, and remains that way until the switch is once again flipped.  This indicates the the induced voltage is caused by a <em class="emphasis">changing</em> magnetic flux <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{d\Phi}{dt}\)</span>and not by the flux alone.</div>

<div class="para">If we put a hot brick into a wheelbarrow and wheel it across the street, we have in one sense “transferred” heat. However, any heat transfer that takes place between the brick and its surroundings while we are wheeling it across the street will be by conduction and by radiation. Therefore, it would really be more accurate to say that we have “transported” the brick and all its contained thermal energy from one side of the street to the other.</div>

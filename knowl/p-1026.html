<div class="para">Steam is formed in the boiler tubes, and since steam bubbles are less dense than the surrounding liquid water, they float up to the top of the boiler and eventually rise above the surface of the water in the steam drum. If the steam was allowed to build up in the drum, the boiler pressure would quickly rise, and if not relieved by the safety valves, would cause the boiler to explode. The system is designed to remove steam as quickly as it is created, so a properly operated boiler will maintain a constant pressure.</div>

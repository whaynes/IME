<div class="para">This valve has a <dfn class="terminology">stem</dfn> with a collar machined on the end. The <dfn class="terminology">disk</dfn>   slides over the collar and is retained on the end of the stem by a <dfn class="terminology">valve disk plug</dfn>  (or  <dfn class="terminology">disk nut</dfn> ) which is attached to the disk by machine threads.   Since the disk plug is prevented from sliding off the end of the stem by the collar, it   effectively fastens the disk to the stem. The disk nut does not lock the disk tightly to   the stem, rather the disk is allowed to move slightly around the collar on the end of   the valve stem. This small movement allows the disk to align itself properly with the   seat as it closes for a leak free seal. In this valve, the stem is also the device that   keeps the disk correctly aligned with the seat, regardless of how far the disk is   removed from the seat.</div>

<div class="para">High steam pressure, if left unchecked will lead to the superheater safety valves lifting. Properly designed and maintained safety valves are capable of relieving the entire boiler to prevent a boiler explosion, but they should never have to open on a properly operated boiler. Low steam pressure will cause a loss of power at the main engines and generators. Failure to respond will lead to electrical blackout of the ship and loss of propulsion power. Incorrect superheat temperature is less harmful than incorrect steam pressure, but you should still note it and correct it if possible. High and low superheat temperatures often indicates another problem with the boiler such as dirty burners, excess air, or incorrect feed temperatures. On ships with controlled superheat, the superheater temperature control system may be faulty.</div>

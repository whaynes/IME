<div class="para">The degree of superheat created in the superheater is determined by several factors, including the temperature of the feedwater, the load on the boiler, and the number and location of burners in use. These factors are not adjustable by the engineer, so the superheater outlet temperature is not under his direct control. A boiler of this type is known as an<em class="emphasis">uncontrolled superheat</em> boiler. Other boiler designs provide a means to control the superheat temperature independent of the above factors, and are known as <em class="emphasis">controlled superheat</em> boilers.</div>

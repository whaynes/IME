<div class="para">All the steam formed in the generating tubes rises up to the steam drum and flows into the dry pipe, and from there the steam, which is dry and at saturation temperature, enters the superheater header and is distributed to the superheater tubes. There, the steam picks up sensible heat, which increases the energy content of the steam, improving the overall steam cycle efficiency and reducing fuel consumption. The steam leaves the boiler at the superheater outlet. At the outlet you will find a <em class="emphasis">superheater vent</em> and a <em class="emphasis">superheater safety valve</em> followed by the main and turbogenerator steam stop valves.</div>

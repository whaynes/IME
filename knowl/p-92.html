<div class="para">The steam drum, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/steamdrum_png.html" title="Figure 1.2.3">Figure 1.2.3</a>, is a cylindrical steel vessel located near the top of the boiler. It serves two purposes: it is an upper reservoir for the water in the boiler, and it is the point where the steam is separated from the water. The normal steam/water interface is located half way up the steam drum, and visible to the operator through the <em class="emphasis">boiler gage glass</em>. It is critical that a water level be maintained in the steam drum at all times when the boiler is operating. Without sufficient water in the boiler, the heat of the furnace would melt the boiler tubes and disable the boiler. One of the engineer’s most critical duties is to maintain the water level in the boiler at all times.</div>

<div class="para">Induction motors have many advantages over other designs.  First they are simple, rugged, reliable and require very little maintenance.  Induction motors are relatively cost-effective to manufacture, and are widely available in a broad size range, for all common single and three-phase voltages.  The can be quite efficient, especially at full load. Modern designs and technologies, such as variable frequency drives (VFDs), contribute to improved efficiency allow precise control of motor speed and performance.</div>

<div class="para">When a rotary pump is operating at a constant speed, the amount of liquid delivered to the discharge line decreases slightly as the discharge pressure working against the pump increases. The drop in discharge capacity is due to increased internal leakage through the close clearances between stationary and moving parts in the pump housing. As the discharge pressure increases, the leakage rate from the discharge to the suction side of the pump, through the internal clearances, increases. This internal leakage reduces the pumpâ€™s discharge capacity, and is known as</div>

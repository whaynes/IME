<div class="para">A good deal of confusion exists concerning the use of the word “heat.” For example, you will hear people say that a hot object “contains” a lot of heat when they really mean that it contains a lot of internal energy. Or you will hear that heat is “added to” or “removed from” a substance. Since heat is the flow of thermal energy, it can no more be added to a substance than the flow of water could be added to a river. (You might add water, and this addition might increase the flow; but you could hardly say that you had added flow.) The only kind of thermal energy that can in any sense be added to or removed from a substance is internal energy. The distinction between heat and internal energy must be clear in your own mind before you can understand the basic principles of a steam plant. Remember, steam contains internal energy but it does not “contain heat.” Heat exists when the internal energy flows from the steam to something else (another substance or system).</div>

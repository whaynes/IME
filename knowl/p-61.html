<div class="para">Vacuum will be maintained in the condenser as long as the shell of the condenser does not fill up with air or other gases, however vacuum tends to draw air into the condenser through any available leaks, such as those found at the <dfn class="terminology">turbine glands</dfn> where the turbine shafts penetrate the turbine casing. This air must be pumped back out to the atmosphere as fast as it leaks in, or else vacuum will be lost. This is accomplished with a steam driven pump known as the <dfn class="terminology">air ejector</dfn> which takes suction on top of the main condenser and discharges air to the engine room.</div>

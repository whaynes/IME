<div class="para">According to US Coast Guard regulations, boilers are required to have <dfn class="terminology">two valve protection</dfn>, that is, they are required to have two valves in series in all boiler connections. This insures that at least one valve will be functional when the time comes to secure the boiler.  The valve which provides this protection is called the <dfn class="terminology">bulkhead stop valve</dfn>.  It is located in the main steam line, downstream of the main steam stop valve.</div>

<div class="para">In the  <dfn class="terminology">diffuser pump</dfn>, the impeller is surrounded by gradually expanding passages formed by stationary guide vanes, sometimes called a diffusion ring, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/diffusertype_png.html" title="Figure 5.3.3">FigureÂ 5.3.3</a>. In these expanding passages the direction of flow is changed and velocity largely converted to pressure before the liquid enters the volute. It is worth noting that the diffuser vanes are set approximately tangent to the ends of the impeller blades. In this kind of casing, efficiency may be slightly higher than in volute pumps, since velocity is more completely converted into pressure. The added cost of manufacture and more complicated construction of diffuser pumps, however, is generally not considered justified except occasionally in the case of large high pressure pumps.</div>

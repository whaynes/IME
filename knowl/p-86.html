<div class="para">Marine boilers provide the steam to turn the propeller, power the generators, make fresh water, operate steam driven pumps and blowers, heat the quarters, support the galley, and meet all other steam requirements of the ship. Operation of the boilers is critical to the operation of the vessel, and marine engineers must have a thorough understanding of boilers in order to operate them safely and economically. Boilers can be dangerous. Improper actions or inactions can lead to a boiler explosion, likely killing everyone in the engine room and perhaps everyone on the ship. The US Coast Guard requires all operators of marine boilers to be competent, and you can not operate a boiler until you have been trained, acquired the required sea experience, and passed the US Coast Guard license exam. Coast Guard Licensing requirements came about as a result of many tragic boiler explosions in the early years of steam propulsion, including the explosion of the <em class="emphasis">Sultana</em>, which killed over 1500 Union soldiers returning home from Vicksburg, Mississippi in April 1865.</div>

<div class="para">The only time a globe valve is installed with fluid pressure applied to the top of the   disk is when the valve is used as a throttle valve controlling steam flow to an engine.   Installed in this manner, if the disk were to become detached from the stem, the disk   would be carried toward the seat by the steam flow. Even if the disk does not close   tightly against the seat, it would choke off steam flow to the engine and cause it to   slow down. Globe throttle valves installed in this manner are considered fail safe. If   the valve was installed with the steam pressure on the bottom of the disk, and the disk   became detached from the stem, the disk would be carried away from the seat by the steam   flow and cause the engine speed to rise uncontrollably. The steam would also carry the   disk toward the engine where it could enter and cause damage.</div>

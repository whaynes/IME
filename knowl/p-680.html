<div class="para">Although most large motors aboard ship are supplied with three-phase power, smaller motors, such as those driving appliances, must operate from single-phase circuits.   <dfn class="terminology">Single-phase motors</dfn> are most often arranged with two sets of stator windings, with the second set supplied from the line connections through a <dfn class="terminology">capacitor</dfn>. The capacitor imposes a phase shift on the line current reaching these windings, to make it look like two-phase AC current. The stator is thus able to develop a rotating magnetic field to drive a rotor.</div>

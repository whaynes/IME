<div class="para">Globe valves are normally installed with the incoming fluid pressure applied to the   bottom of the valve disk, that is, to the side of the disk that closes against the seat.   The top of the disk is the side that does not close against the seat and, in most globe   valves, is the side in contact with the valve stem. When fluid pressure is applied to   the bottom of the disk, the pressure helps the operator open the valve, and the pressure   on the valve packing is relieved when the valve is closed.</div>

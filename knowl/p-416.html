<div class="para">The impellers used in volute and diffuser pumps are of three kinds, <em class="emphasis">open</em>, <em class="emphasis">semi-open</em>, and <em class="emphasis">enclosed</em> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/impellers_png.html" title="Figure 4.3.4">FigureÂ 4.3.4</a>. The open impeller consists only of blades attached to a hub. The semi-open impeller is constructed with a circular plate, called the web, on the inside edge of the blades. The web need not extend all the way out to the ends of the blades. The use of a web makes it possible to use thinner blades. In the case of the enclosed impeller, a shroud is added on the outside edge of the blades, so that the liquid is in large measure confined in the blade region, between the web and the shroud. Holding the liquid between these plates reduces friction losses in the pump. Open and semi-open impellers are normally found in pumps that must handle relatively large solids in the liquid, such as sewage pumps.</div>

<dfn class="terminology">Resistance</dfn> is a property of a material or component in an electrical circuit that opposes the flow of electric current. It is measured in ohms (Î©) and is denoted by the symbol <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Resistance determines the extent to which a material or device hinders the flow of electrical charge. When a voltage is applied across a conductor, the resistance restricts the flow of current, resulting in a decrease in the magnitude of the current. Materials with high resistance impede the flow of electricity more than materials with low resistance. The resistance of a component depends on factors such as its length, cross-sectional area, and the material it is made of.</div>

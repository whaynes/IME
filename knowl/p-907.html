<h0 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h0><div class="para">In this chapter we will discuss steam propulsion and the steam cycle. The steam cycle is the thermodynamic process which marine engineers use to transform the energy contained in the ship’s fuel oil or <em class="emphasis">bunkers</em> into the power to turn the ship’s propeller and supply all the other requirements necessary to move a steam ship from one point to another. We will begin with a discussion of a very simplified version of the steam cycle, which nevertheless illustrates all the important principles of its operation. Later, we will progress to a more detailed, practical, and efficient version of the cycle, which more closely represents the cycle used on other steam ships. The function of each of the components of the cycle will be briefly described here, and in more detail in later chapters. This cycle described here is not the only possibility, but it is representative, and it provides a good foundation for further study.</div>

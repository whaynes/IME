<dfn class="terminology">Gear pumps</dfn> are probably the most common type of rotary pump, and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/gear_pump_png.html" title="Figure 5.3.9">FigureÂ 5.3.9</a> illustrates a typical example. The liquid is carried from the suction to the discharge in the spaces between the gear teeth and the surface of the pump casing as the gears rotate. One of the gears is directly driven by the source of power, while the other, called the   rotates with it in the opposite direction. This is accomplished either because motion is imparted from the drive gear to the idler gear by the meshing of the two gears at the center of the pump chamber, or because   outside the pump chamber transmit motion from one gear shaft to the other.</div>

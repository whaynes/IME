<div class="para">Generators produce lots of heat while they are operating due to unavoidable losses caused by mechanical friction and electrical resistance, and other factors.  If this heat is not removed as it is produced, the generator temperature will rise to unacceptable limits, and high temperature is extremely damaging to electrical insulation. Electrical machines are designed to run for 100,000 hours or more when operated at or below their design temperature limit, however for every 10Â° C rise above this temperature, the thermal life expectancy of the electrical insulation is reduced by half, so generator cooling is critical.</div>

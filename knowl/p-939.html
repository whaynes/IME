<div class="para">Impeller vanes which curve backwards with respect to their direction of rotation are more efficient and give better performance than straight vanes; however, the pump must be turned in the correct direction to obtain this efficiency. The advantage of straight vane impellers is that they have the same efficiency in either direction of pump rotation. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/centpump_png.html" title="Figure 5.3.2">FigureÂ 5.3.2</a>, the impeller rotation is counter-clockwise allowing the liquid to be pushed around the pump chamber by the vanes, rather than being carried by them. If a curved vane impeller was operated in the wrong direction rotation, it would still deliver some liquid, but the following would be observed:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">The pump would require more power to turn the impellor backwards.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The pump discharge capacity would decrease.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The pump efficiency would decrease.</div></li>

<div class="para">The air and gas flow paths through the boiler are shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/boilergasflow_png.html" title="Figure 1.2.5">FigureÂ 1.2.5</a>. Air supplied by the forced draft fan passes across the tubes of a steam heated air heater, and then through the boiler casing where it picks up more heat. The air passes through the register and into the furnace, where it meets up with fuel sprayed by the atomizer. It immediately ignites, and the burner flame liberates heat energy from the fuel to heat the water in the boiler. Some of this heat is in the form of thermal radiation which shines on the exposed screen and wall tubes. Other energy resides in the thermal energy of the combustion gases. These hot combustion gases flow from the furnace through the screen tubes, past the superheater tubes and the main generating bank and finally across the economizer tubes, losing heat and dropping in temperature along the way. Finally, the hot combustion gases pass up the smokestack to the atmosphere.</div>

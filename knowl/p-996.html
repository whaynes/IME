<div class="para">Steam generation occurs in the boiler. The boiler is simply a device used to boil water. Like a tea-kettle on the stove, it contains liquid water and a heat source. As the water is heated, its temperature rises and soon it begins to boil. On the stove, the water vapor or steam rises and dissipates into the kitchen, but not so in a boiler. The boiler is a closed vessel, like a pot with a lid, and any steam generated in the boiler rises to the top and is collected before being sent on to the next step of the cycle.</div>

<div class="para">Heat energy is added to the cycle by burning fuel oil in the boiler. The high temperature flames raise the temperature of the water in the boiler and eventually cause it to boil. Not all energy of the fuel is transferred to the water, some remains in the combustion gases and travels up the stack. This energy will be lost to the atmosphere unless it is recovered by economizers or air heaters located in the exhaust path. Any heat energy lost to the atmosphere represents waste and steam cycle inefficiency.</div>

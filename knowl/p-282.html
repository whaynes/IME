<div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Current</dfn> refers to the flow of electric charge in an electrical circuit. It is the rate at which electric charges, typically electrons, move through a <dfn class="terminology">conductor</dfn>. Current is measured in amperes (A) and is represented by the symbol <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> It can be thought of as the quantity of charge passing through a point in a circuit per unit of time. The flow of current occurs when there is a potential difference (voltage) applied across a conductor, providing the driving force for the movement of electric charges.</div>

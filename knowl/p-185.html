<div class="para">A better definition of energy, therefore, states that “energy is the capacity for producing an effect.” Energy exists in many forms. For convenience, we usually classify energy according to the size and nature of the bodies or particles with which it is associated. Thus we say that <em class="emphasis">Mechanical energy</em> is the energy associated with large bodies or objects, usually, things that are big enough to see. <em class="emphasis">Thermal energy</em> is energy associated with molecules. <em class="emphasis">Chemical energy</em> is energy that arises from the forces which bind the atoms together in a molecule, Chemical energy is demonstrated whenever combustion or any other chemical reaction takes place. <em class="emphasis">Electro-magnetic</em> energy is energy that is associated with the electron and charged particles. Light, x-rays and radio waves are examples of electro-magnetic energy. <em class="emphasis">Nuclear energy</em> is associated with the particles in the nucleus, and is governed by Einstein’s famous equation <span class="process-math">\(E = mc^2\)</span>nEach of these types of energy (mechanical energy, thermal energy, etc.) must also be classified as being either stored energy, or energy in transition. <em class="emphasis">Stored energy</em> can be thought of as energy that is actually “contained in” or “stored in” a substance or system. There are two kinds of stored energy: potential energy, and kinetic energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the relative <em class="emphasis">positions</em> of two or more objects or particles, we call it potential energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the relative <em class="emphasis">velocities</em> of two or more objects or particles, we call it kinetic energy.</div>

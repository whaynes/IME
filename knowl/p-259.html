<div class="para">The same relationships apply when heat is being removed. The removal of 42 BTU from the pound of steam which is at 300 °F will cause the temperature to drop to 212 °F. As the pound of steam at 212 °F changes to a pound of water at 212 °F, 970 BTU are given off. When a substance is changing from a gas or vapor to a liquid, we usually use the term <em class="emphasis">latent heat of condensation</em> for the heat that is given off. Notice, however, that the latent heat of condensation is exactly the same as the latent heat of vaporization. Only the terms differ to indicate whether a substance is being changed into a liquid or into a gas. The removal of another 180 BTU of sensible heat will lower the temperature of the pound of water from 212 °F to 32 °F. As the pound of water at 32 °F changes to a pound of ice at 32 °F 144 BTU are given off without any accompanying change of temperature. Further removal of heat causes the temperature of the ice to decrease.</div>

<dfn class="terminology">Butterfly valves</dfn> can be used for on-off operation as well as throttling or regulating fluid flow. They are light weight, require little installation space, have low initial cost, are simple in design and can be easily repaired. Like plug and ball type valves, it is only necessary to rotate the valve stem a quarter turn on a butterfly valve to go from the full open to the closed position. Manual operating levers on butterfly valves are parallel to the piping when the valve is open and perpendicular to the piping when the valve is closed. 90Â° valve stem operation makes them very adaptable to automatic and remote control actuators.</div>

<div class="para">Maintaining proper boiler water level in the steam drum is probably the most critical aspect of boiler operation. <em class="emphasis">High Water</em> is harmful because it reduces the efficiency of the steam separators. More importantly, excessively high water will enter the dry pipe, pass through the superheater and enter the turbine â€“ a condition known as <em class="emphasis">carryover</em>. Carryover leads to dangerous <em class="emphasis">water hammer</em> in the steam lines, scaling in the superheater, and will damage to turbine rotors and thrust bearings. <em class="emphasis">Low Water</em> is perhaps even more harmful than high water. It the boiler water level falls too low, portions of the generating tubes will be uncovered and the furnace temperature will quickly overheat and weaken the boiler tubes, leading to catastrophic boiler damage, steam escape, and personnel injury.</div>

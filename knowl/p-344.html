<div class="para">A peculiar thing happens to water and steam at an absolute pressure of 3206.2 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature at 705.40 °F. At this point, which is called the <em class="emphasis">critical point,</em> the vapor and the liquid are indistinguishable. No change of state occurs when the pressure is increased above this point or when heat is added. At the critical point, we can no longer refer to “water” or “steam,” since we cannot tell the water and steam apart. Instead, the substance is merely called a “fluid” or a “working substance.” Boilers designed to operate at pressures and temperatures above the critical point are called <em class="emphasis">supercritical</em> boilers. Supercritical boilers are not used, at present, in propulsion plants of ships; however, some boilers of this type are used in stationary steam power plants.</div>

<div class="para">The feed water regulator system is designed to monitor and maintain the water level in the boiler automatically under all normal loads and operating conditions. The main feed pump takes a suction from the DC Heater, and discharges through the feedwater regulating valve, then into the economizer and the steam drum. The feedwater regulator contains a <em class="emphasis">drum level sensor</em> which opens or closes the regulating valve in response to the drum water level. When the water level goes up, the regulating valve closes off to restrict the feed water to the drum and bring the level down, and vice versa. This drum level sensing regulator uses <em class="emphasis">feedback control</em>, which means that is has a fairly slow response; the drum level must deviate from normal before the regulator can make a correction. To improve the regulator response, most feedwater regulator systems also include a steam flow sensor, which gives the regulator a predictive ability known as <em class="emphasis">feedforward control</em>. As soon as the sensor detects a change in the steam flow, it can respond immediately with a corresponding change in the feedwater flow rate. Feedwater regulators containing both drum level and steam flow sensors are known as <em class="emphasis">two-element</em> feedwater regulators.</div>

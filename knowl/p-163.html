<div class="para">For navigation on water (marine), air, and space the nautical mile unit of length is used. Historically, a nautical mile was defined as the meridian arc length corresponding to one minute of a degree of latitude.  Nautical mile is based on Earth’s circumference being 360 degrees. These degrees can then be divided into 60 minutes. One of these minutes (or minutes of arc as they are called in navigation) along a great circle on Earth represents one nautical mile. Today the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1,852 meters (6,076 ft; 1.151 mi).</div>

<div class="para">Can you define energy? Although everyone has a general idea of the meaning of energy, a good definition is hard to find. Most commonly, perhaps, energy is defined as the “ability of a system to do work.” This is not a very complete definition. Energy can produce other effects which cannot possibly be considered “work.” For example, heat can flow from one object to another without doing work; yet heat is a form of energy, and the process of heat transfer is a process that produces an effect.</div>

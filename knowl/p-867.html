<dfn class="terminology">Single stage pumps</dfn> contain only one impeller, drawing in the liquid and expelling it through the discharge into the liquid system. A double-suction, single-stage pump is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/doublesuction_png.html" title="Figure 5.3.5">FigureÂ 5.3.5</a>. A disadvantage of the single-stage pump, however, is that discharge pressure cannot be increased above the maximum working pressure of the impeller design operating at a given speed. Above this limit, under practical working conditions, the pump will not deliver any further increase in pressure. Most volute type, single stage pumps do not operate at speeds in excess of 3600 RPM and typically produce maximum discharge pressures in the 150 to 200 psi range. Diffuser type, single stage pumps may operate at speeds as high as 8000 RPM and produce discharge pressures in excess of 1000 psi; turbine driven boiler feed pumps are sometimes this type.</div>

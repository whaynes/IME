<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">valve body</dfn> contains the internal opening that the fluid flows through. It   is called the <em class="emphasis">seat</em> if the opening is machined directly into the valve body   material. It is called a <em class="emphasis">seat ring</em> if it is a separate and replaceable part   from the valve body. Replaceable seat rings are generally manufactured from harder,   longer wearing materials than the valve body to be more resistant to fluid erosion at   this location. Seat rings may be retained in the valve body by machine screw threads,   press fit, welding or by what is known as a <em class="emphasis">shrink fit</em>. In shrink fit   applications, the machined hole in the valve body that the seat ring fits into is a few   thousandths of an inch smaller in diameter than the outside diameter of the seat ring.   Therefore, it is impossible for the ring to fit into the hole in the valve body. During   assembly the valve body is heated, causing the machined seat ring hole to expand. The   seat ring is also frozen at the same time to decrease its outside diameter. With both   parts at the proper temperature, the seat ring now has an outside diameter that is   smaller than the inside diameter of the machined hole in the valve body. At this point,   the seat ring is placed quickly and accurately into the valve body. As the temperature   of the two parts begin to equalize, the ring expands and the machined hole shrinks and   places a compressive force around the outside of the ring, locking it very tightly in   place.</div>

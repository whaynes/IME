<h0 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h0><div class="para">Over the last 50 or so years steam and steam turbines as a means of ship propulsion have been supplanted by low and medium speed diesel engines, mainly because motor ships have better fuel efficiency, are easier to automate, requires less maintenance, and can be operated with smaller crews — all factors leading to lower operating costs — than steam ships. Nevertheless, steam propulsion remains important, because steam power is still used extensively in industry and power generation ashore, and the skills of a steam engineer find high demand in the shoreside job market.</div>

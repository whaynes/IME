<div class="para">Steam temperature is raised even further by <dfn class="terminology">superheating</dfn> the steam. Superheating steam raises its temperature above the saturation temperature for the corresponding steam pressure by continuing to add heat to the steam after it has completely vaporized. This must take place in a separate area, called the <em class="emphasis">superheater,</em> away from liquid water, or the additional heat would simply boil more water rather than superheating the steam. Superheated steam is said to be <em class="emphasis">dry</em>, which means that all liquid water has vaporized and it contains no moisture droplets. Drops of liquid water would damage the turbine in the expansion step described below.</div>

<div class="para">Steam is generated by burning fuel in the furnace, heating and boiling the water contained inside the tubes and the drums at the top and bottom of the boiler. The gases of combustion flow over the tubes, and since the water temperature within the tubes is lower than the gas temperature, heat flows from the combustion gases into the water. As the heat flows into the water, the water temperature starts to rise, and continues to rise until the water begins to boil. The boiling water forms vapor bubbles like those seen on the bottom of a pan on the stove. The specific volume of these vapor or steam bubbles is about 1600 times greater than the specific volume of the surrounding water. Since density is the inverse of specific volume, the steam bubbles float and rise up to the highest point, the <em class="emphasis">steam drum</em>. From there, the steam is collected and directed into the superheater tubes, where it picks up additional heat energy, and then is sent on to the main engine as superheated steam to propel the ship or serve other functions.</div>

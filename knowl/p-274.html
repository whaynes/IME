<div class="para">When measuring a vacuum, there are three possible methods. When vacuum is measured starting with zero at perfect vacuum and increasing as pressure rises, then the greater the value, the smaller the vacuum. This is known as the absolute pressure scale. We can also measure pressure on a scale starting at zero at atmospheric pressure, and indicating negative values when the pressure is below atmospheric (vacuum) and positive values when the pressure is above atmospheric. This is the behavior of a standard pressure gage. And finally, we can measure vacuum on a scale starting with zero at atmospheric pressure and increasing as the vacuum increases. Most vacuum gages operate this way. On this scale no vacuum would be indicated by 0 psig, and a perfect vacuum would be indicated by approximately 14.7 psi vacuum.</div>

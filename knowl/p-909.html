<div class="para">The steam cycle is an example of what is known by engineers as a <em class="emphasis">cyclic heat engine</em>. It is called cyclic, because it operates on a cycle. It uses a <em class="emphasis">working fluid</em>, water, which travels from point to point through the cycle, changing form and carrying energy, but eventually returning to the starting point restored to the same <em class="emphasis">state</em> that it started with. It is called a heat engine, because it transforms <em class="emphasis">heat</em>, which is a form of energy, into <em class="emphasis">work</em>, another form of energy. The thermodynamic name for this cycle is the <em class="emphasis">Rankine Cycle.</em>

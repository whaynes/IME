<div class="para">Improving efficiency is a major concern of mechanical and marine engineers. High efficiency means that fuel is not wasted, and operating costs are minimized. Practical boiler designs incorporate many techniques to maximize efficiency. For example, not all of the chemical energy originally contained by the fuel ends up transferred to the steam. A large portion of this energy is lost up the smokestack, carried away by the combustion gases. Practical boilers usually contain some sort of heat exchanger in the smokestack in an effort to recover some of this energy.</div>

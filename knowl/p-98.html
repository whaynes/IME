<div class="para">The <em class="emphasis">water drum</em>, also known as the <em class="emphasis">mud drum</em>, is another cylindrical vessel, usually smaller in diameter than the steam drum and located at the bottom of the boiler, which acts as a lower reservoir for water. The water drum also serves as a collection point for the sludge that normally forms in the boiler as chemicals precipitate out of the boiler water as it is evaporated. These solids can be removed by a <em class="emphasis">bottom blow</em> which discharges them over the side.</div>

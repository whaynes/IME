<div class="para">Impellers may also be  single or  double-suction. The former consists of a single impeller drawing liquid in from one side through one eye, while the double suction impeller is similar to a pair of single suction impellers placed back to back, placing an eye on each side of the impeller so that the liquid is drawn into the impeller from opposite directions. Double suction impellers can handle greater capacities of liquid than a single suction impeller of the same size and operating speed. This is because the larger inlet area of the two suction eyes provides less resistance to liquid flow into the impeller.</div>

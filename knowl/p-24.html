<div class="para">It is unfortunate that some of the energy once contained by the fuel, and then passed on to the steam in the boiler, is eventually thrown away with the seawater. Wouldn’t it be better to somehow use this energy to power the ship? Absolutely, but there is nothing we can do about it! The only way to extract more energy from the steam is by having the turbine discharge to an even lower absolute pressure than we do. The only way to do that is to condense the steam at even lower temperatures than we are. But we can’t do that, because aboard ship there’s nothing colder than the surrounding ocean available to reject the heat to. If we decided not to reject any heat to the ocean at all, the pressure in the condenser would build up to the point where it would equal the steam pressure entering the turbine, and without a pressure drop, the steam would stop flowing altogether. There’s no win, but we’re doing the best we can.</div>

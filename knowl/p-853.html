<div class="para">Globe valves cause a relatively large pressure drop in the fluid as it flows through   the valve. Pressure drops are caused by the friction created when the fluid changes   direction of flow through the valve. The straight globe valve, with the pipe connections   180 degrees opposite each other, has the greatest pressure drop through it due to three   to five changes in direction of fluid flow. The right angle valve has a 90 degree angle   between the inlet and outlet pipe connections and fluid flow only changes direction one   or two times, creating less pressure drop than the straight type. Globe valves are also   constructed with 45 or 60 degree angles between the stem and the outlet side of the   valve. This valve design also creates less change in direction of fluid flow, reducing   pressure drop through the valve.</div>

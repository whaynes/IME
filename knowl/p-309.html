<div class="para">In general, a valve is a device installed in a piping system to control the amount, direction or pressure of the contained fluid flowing through the pipe lines. Most valves control fluid flow with a carefully designed moving part which can fully open, partially open (called <em class="emphasis">throttling</em>), or close an opening called an <em class="emphasis">orifice</em> inside the valve. Since the valve must stop all fluid flow when it is closed, the surface of the moving part that covers the opening and the surface surrounding the stationary opening must be precisely machined and fitted. In many valves, both these surfaces are metal and they must seal tightly against one another without the aid of gaskets or seals between them.</div>

<dfn class="terminology">Marine boilers</dfn> supply the steam required for propulsion, as well as any other steam requirements of the vessel. Marine propulsion boilers are normally fired with heavy fuel oil, or in a few cases today, coal.  Marine boilers, while similar to boilers found ashore, are designed to meet the particular requirements of shipboard use. They are designed to be light and compact to fit into small engine rooms, capable of operating under rapidly changing loads when the vessel is maneuvering, and to operate reliably while the vessel is pitching and rolling during a storm.</div>

<div class="para">Circuits are <dfn class="terminology">grounded</dfn> by connecting them to ground. This <dfn class="terminology">ground connection</dfn> provides an alternate path for electrical currents to flow back to the source. Ashore, electrical circuits are grounded by connecting them electrically to a rod or pipe driven into the earth, while aboard ship, a connection the hull serves the same purpose.    A <dfn class="terminology">chassis ground</dfn>, refers to the point on the metal frame or outer casing (chassis) of an electrical or electronic device where the circuit is grounded.  The chassis itself is grounded to the earth or the hull. Ground also refers to a reference point used for voltage measurements.  Finally a ground or <dfn class="terminology">ground fault</dfn> can refer to an accidental connection between the circuit and ground</div>

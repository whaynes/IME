<div class="para">The body has two seats inside facing each other. One surrounds the inlet opening and   the other the outlet opening. The distance between the seats nearest the bonnet opening   is greater than the distance between the seats at the bottom of the valve body creating   a wedge shape between them. The gate is moved down from the bonnet location between the   two seats. It has a machined surface on both sides and has a wedge shape that matches   the two seats forcing it to seal tightly against both seats when it is pushed down   between them.</div>

<div class="para">The three basic physical states of all matter are <em class="emphasis">solid,</em> <em class="emphasis">liquid,</em> and <em class="emphasis">gas</em> (or vapor). The physical state of a substance is closely related to the distance between molecules. The molecules are closest together in solids, farther apart in liquids, and farthest apart in gases. When the flow of heat to a substance is not reflected in a temperature change, we know that the energy is being used to increase the distance between the molecules of the substance and thus to change it from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. Such a change is known as a <em class="emphasis">phase change</em>. You might say that latent heat is the energy price that must be paid for a change of state from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. The energy is not lost; rather, it is stored in the substance as internal energy. The energy price is “repaid,” so to speak, when the substance changes back from gas to liquid or from liquid to solid.</div>

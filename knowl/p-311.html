<div class="para">If you have trouble with the idea that mechanical kinetic energy is stored, rather than in transition, think of it like this. A bullet that has been fired from a gun has mechanical kinetic energy because it is in motion. The faster the bullet is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. There is no doubt in anybodyâ€™s mind that the bullet has the capacity to produce an effect, so we may safely say that it has energy. Although the bullet is in transition, the energy of the bullet is not transferred to any other object or system until the bullet strikes some object which resists its passage. When the bullet strikes against a resisting object, then, and only then, can we say that energy in transition exists, in the form of heat and work.</div>

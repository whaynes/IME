<div class="para">Globe valves are designed for tight closure and throttling applications. When a globe   valve is used to throttle or regulate fluid flow, the disk surface that closes against   the seat should be made from metal, not synthetic materials. Throttling a fluid creates   erosion (wearing away) of the disk surface and the seat surface that the fluid flows   between. This erosion may show up as general roughness or as small grooves cut across   the surfaces of the seat and disk, called <em class="emphasis">wire drawing</em>. These defects on the   precisely machined surfaces of the seat and disk result in leakage when the valve is   closed. In service where erosion will be a problem, the seat and disk can be fabricated   from very hard materials, such as stellite, to extend the life of the seat and disk   contact surfaces.</div>

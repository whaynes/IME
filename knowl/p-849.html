<div class="para">This valve stem uses <dfn class="terminology">Acme Threads</dfn>, a thread type with no points, just below   the point where the <dfn class="terminology">hand-wheel</dfn> is installed. The valve stem threads engage the   internal threads of the <em class="emphasis">yolk bushing</em>, which is made from a softer material than   the valve stem, e.g. bronze, brass etc. If the stem has too much rotational force   applied, the yoke bushing threads strip instead of the valve stem threads. The yoke   bushing is a replaceable part and is screwed into the upper part of the bonnet with   machine threads. When the valve hand-wheel is turned in the clockwise direction, the   valve stem threads engaged with the yoke bushing threads cause the stem to move inward   pushing the disk toward the seat closing the valve.</div>

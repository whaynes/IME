<div class="para">A centrifugal pump consists of a rotating element called the  <dfn class="terminology">impeller</dfn>, which is the only moving part in the pump, and a specially shaped housing, or pump  casing. In practically all centrifugal pumps, liquid enters the rotating element at the center through the  <dfn class="terminology">eye</dfn>, and is given a rotary motion in the pump chamber by the rotation of a number of impeller blades (generally called  <dfn class="terminology">vanes</dfn>). The rotation of the impeller in a true centrifugal pump does two things. Centrifugal force drives the liquid directly out from the center of the impeller, setting up a greater pressure in the chamber at the outer edge of the impeller than at the eye. At the same time the liquid is also pushed around and around by the turning of the vanes, and is given more and more velocity as it moves farther out from the eye. The liquid finally leaves the impeller tangentially at the end of the vanes with a high velocity, and flows into the discharge passage of the pump housing surrounding the impeller.</div>

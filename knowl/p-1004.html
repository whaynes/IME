<div class="para">The thermal energy added to the working fluid in the generation stage is converted to mechanical energy, or work, in the expansion stage. This work is produced in the form of a rotating turbine shaft which drives the propeller and moves the ship through the water. The more energy we can remove at this stage, the higher the efficiency of the steam cycle. Unfortunately, it is not possible to remove all the energy from the steam in the turbine. Some energy remains in the steam and is carried to the next stage of the cycle.</div>

\f0\fs24 \cf2 <$Scr_Ps::0>
\f1\fs32 The ability to install the prime mover in any convenient location, without being restricted to a direct line with the propeller. Power is transmitted through flexible cable runs, as opposed to rigid line shafts. Furthermore, instead of relying on a single large main engine, multiple smaller engines can be used, allowing for placement in smaller spaces and more convenient locations.

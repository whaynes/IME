\f1\fs32 Engine displacement is one of the terms used to compare one engine to another. Displacement refers to the total volume displaced by all the pistons during one stroke. The displacement is usually given in cubic inches or liters. To calculate the displacement of an engine, the volume of one cylinder must be determined (volume of a cylinder = (\uc0\u960 r2)h where h = the stroke). The volume of one cylinder is multiplied by the number of cylinders to obtain the total engine displacement.

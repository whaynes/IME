\f1\fs32 A pipe elbow is a fitting used to join two sections of straight pipes at an angle.  \
Standard elbows are available in 90\'b0 (e) , 45\'b0 (f) and less commonly 22.5\'b0 (g) angles.  A

\f2\b\fs32 long radius elbows
\f0\b0\fs24 <!$Scr_Cs::1>
\f1\fs32  is about one and a half diameters. Long radius elbows produce less turbulence in the fluid which results in reduced frictional losses and pressure drop, but they take up more room and are more expensive.

\f1\fs32 By employing multiple generators operating in parallel, ships can secure one or more engines under reduced load conditions. The remaining engines can then operate at nearly full load, resulting in improved efficiency compared to having more engines operating at part-load. Load management systems continuously monitor the electrical demand and promptly initiate the startup of an additional generator when necessary.

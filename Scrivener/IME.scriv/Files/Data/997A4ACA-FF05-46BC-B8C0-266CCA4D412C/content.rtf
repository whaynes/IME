\f1\fs28 While the simplified steam cycle discussed in the previous section could be built, and it would work, several modifications are required to make it practical for steam propulsion and to improve its efficiency. \
The actual steam cycle that was used for propulsion on MMA\'92s old ship <em>TS Kennedy</em>  is shown in <xref ref="main_steam_cycle_fig"/>. Each of the components of this cycle will be briefly discussed in the following sections, in its order in the cycle.\

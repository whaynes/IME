\f1\fs32 A confined space is defined by OSHA as a space that has limited or restricted means of entry, is not designed for continuous occupancy, and is large enough and configured so that a person can enter the space and maneuver well enough to perform tasks.  \
Confined spaces pose several hazards that can endanger workers who enter  them due to their limited entry and exit points, restricted airflow, and potential for hazardous atmospheres. \
On ships, some examples of confined spaces include:  Cargo and fuel tanks, cofferdams, pressure vessels, sewage tanks, and void spaces. \

            <Title>Eye Protection</Title>
            <Text>Every day more than 1,000 eye injuries occur in American workplaces. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that three out of five workers who suffered eye injuries were not wearing eye protective equipment at the time of the accident, and when asked why, the victims often claimed that eye protection was not normally used in their type of work, or it was not required for the type of work performed at the time of the accident. Eye protection can save your sight, but you must be wearing it.
Eye injuries can occur in many ways, but are primarily caused by rapidly flying objects. The BLS found that almost 70% of eye injuries were caused by flying or falling objects or sparks striking the eye. Most of these objects were smaller than a pin head, and were traveling faster than a hand-thrown object. Another 20% of eye injuries were caused by chemicals, and the remainder due to miscellaneous causes such as objects swinging into the eye, pulled into the eye or by light radiation.
Eye injuries can be prevented by wearing effective eye protection. To be effective, the eyewear must be of the appropriate type for the hazard encountered and properly fitted. The BLS survey found that 94% of the injuries to workers wearing eye protection were caused by objects or chemicals going around or under the protector. Goggles provide better protection than face shields or safety glasses, but the best protection is afforded when both goggles and a face shield are worn together.</Text>

            <Title>Arc Flash and Arc Blast</Title>
            <Text>Arc flash refers to the release of intense heat, light, and energy that occurs during an electrical fault or short circuit. It is characterized by a sudden and violent discharge of electrical energy through the air. The arc flash generates extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit (19,400 degrees Celsius). The intense heat emitted during an arc flash can cause severe burns to anyone in its vicinity. Additionally, the arc flash produces a bright flash of light, which can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment.
Arc blast, on the other hand, refers to the high-pressure shockwave produced by the rapid expansion of air during an arc flash. The rapid expansion of these vapors creates a blast wave that can cause significant physical damage. Arc blasts can result in powerful pressure waves, similar to those generated by an explosion, which can cause injuries, such as concussions, fractures, hearing loss, and even fatalities. The arc blast can propel debris, molten metal, and hot gases, further exacerbating the risk to individuals in the vicinity.</Text>

            <Text>Chemicals that are improperly stored or incompatible substances stored in close proximity can react with one another, causing fires, explosions, or the release of toxic gases. Inadequate storage practices may also result in spills, leaks, or contamination, endangering both employees and the environment. 
It is essential to follow proper storage procedures, including segregating incompatible chemicals, labeling containers correctly, ensuring proper ventilation and temperature control, and implementing appropriate containment measures such as spill kits and secondary containment systems.  The MSDS will contain instructions regarding proper storage.
In particular, aboard ship chemical containers must always be secured so that they don’t break free and cause accidents during heavy weather.   </Text>

            <Text>
Inside the “Draft” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will typically be taken care of automatically by LaTeX.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each section inside the chapter folders. Sections will be numbered and titled by LaTeX using hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
Nest documents beneath documents to create numbered subsections, subsubsections and unnumbered paragraphs, at 3rd, 4th and 5th levels of hierarchy respectively.
If you need to create the occasional unnumbered section, the Informal Chapter and Informal Section Types are there for you.
If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document in the Front Matter folder to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface”, “Abstract” or “Introduction” as you require. Any other prefacing materials could be placed between the preamble and the main matter document.
“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents $&gt;$ Change Icon feature).

Foreward
Non-fiction works often feature a foreword or preface. This usually comes after the table of contents, but not always—sometimes the foreword precedes the table of contents. If you need your foreword to come before the table of contents, move the \tableofcontents command in the “Preamble Addendum” document after “Foreword” document. You can also rename “Foreword” to ”Preface” or ”Introduction”, or delete it entirely, depending on your requirements.
The table of contents is generated automatically by LATEX, using the natural structure of the Draft folder’s outline in Scrivener’s. If you were using Scrivener in a more typical fashion, there would be a long list of instructions here on how to create a table of contents and manually keep it up to date over time.

Folder Names as Chapter Titles
The goal of this template is make the composition and drafting phase as simple and elegant as possible. It is not meant to turn Scrivener, a rich text editor, into a full-blown LaTeX generator (you’ll need to use MultiMarkdown or Pandoc for that). Instead, this project contains a number of convenience features that could be applied to your work as you wish in an la carte fashion, to alleviate how much code you’d need to type in yourself. For example, if you find handling images to be cumbersome in LaTeX, you can safely leave that up to the template.
Ultimately, it’s goal is to cater to those that by and large prefer to compose directly in LaTeX itself, and will be approaching Scrivener primarily as an organ- isational and composition tool for constructing a longer .tex file from the smaller snippets written into the Draft folder.
1.1 How To Use This Template
1. Inside the “Draft” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter num- bering will typically be taken care of automatically by LaTeX.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
2. Create a new text document for each section inside the chapter folders. Sec- tions will be numbered and titled by LaTeX using hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
3. Nest documents beneath documents to create numbered subsections, subsub- sections and unnumbered paragraphs, at 3rd, 4th and 5th levels of hierarchy respectively.

CHAPTER 1. FOLDER NAMES AS CHAPTER TITLES 2
4. If you need to create the occasional unnumbered section, the Informal Chap-
ter and Informal Section Types are there for you.
5. If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document in the Front Matter folder to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface”, “Ab- stract” or “Introduction” as you require. Any other prefacing materials could be placed between the preamble and the main matter document.
6. “Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, al- though you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents&gt;Change Icon feature).
1.2 Some Sample Content
Foremost, any LaTeX you type in yourself will be dutifully conveyed to the output. The compile settings also have a few shortcuts you can use to ease typing, or grant yourself a nicer looking working document. Graphics that you place into the editor (linked or embedded) will be exported simply wherever they occur in the text. For more formal figures there are two approaches you can take (you needn’t commit to either exclusively).
Figures
Figure 1.1: This is the caption.
To modify how styled text is converted to LaTeX code, visit the Markup and Styles compile format panes, when editing this project’s ”LaTeX (Memoir Book)” format. The Markup pane itself sets how graphics print themselves, which is the \includegraphics line alone. The stylesheet settings for Figure, Caption and Label determine how the additional syntax is added around that.

CHAPTER 1. FOLDER NAMES AS CHAPTER TITLES 3 Equations
We can also insert equations as discrete items in the binder, making them easy to reference and look up by type. It also means we can refer to them in our writings with the use of simple internal document links (Equation 1.1).
x2 = 5−√25−4×6 =2 (1.1) 2
When you need to refer to an equation in the body text (β = (β1, β2, . . . , βn)), you can use the Inline Equation style which will insert the $ and $ codes for you.
Equations can also be inserted unnumbered

Another Chapter Folder
Begin each new chapter on a new top level folder like this. With LaTeX, the chapter numbering and formatting is handled automatically by the typesetting engine. Scrivener is only responsible for assembling the LaTeX code that will be used to generate these structures.
If you need parts, or if you don’t need chapters, the automatic assignment of structure to the outline can be adjusted in project settings, under the Section Types pane.

            <Title>Types of Respirators</Title>
            <Text>OSHA divides respirators into two categories:

Fig: ppe/respirators1.jpg "Air-purifying respirator" class=right

**Air-purifying Respirators.** These units have filters, cartridges, or canisters that remove contaminants from the air by passing the air through the air-purifying element before it reaches the user. Air purifying respirators are further divided into:

-   *Particulate Respirators*, which capture particles such as dusts,     paint fumes, and mists, but do not protect against gases and vapors.     The filters in particulate respirators generally work better as     particles accumulate on the filter. If the filter becomes so clogged     that it is difficult to breathe, it should be replaced.

-   *Gas and Vapor Respirators*, which use a chemical cartridge or     canister to remove dangerous gases or vapors, but which do not     protect against airborne particles. These units only protect against     specific gases or vapors, and only provide protection as long as the     filter’s absorbing capacity remains.

-   *Combination Respirators*, which can be used in atmospheres that     contain both hazardous gases and particles.

Fig: ppe/respirators2.jpg "Atmosphere-supplying respirators" class=right

**Atmosphere-supplying Respirators.** These units supply clean air directly to the user from a source other than the air surrounding the user. The types of air-supplying respirators are:

-   *Air Supplied Respirators*, which have a hose which connects to a     source of clean air under pressure. These units have no time limit on the air supply, but the hose limits the range and mobility of the user and is susceptible to damage.

-   *Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus*, which have a wearable     clean-air supply pack. These units have better mobility than the air-supplied respirator, but the clean air time is limited to the     capacity of the tank.

-   *Combination Respirators*, which are similar to the air-supplied     respirators, but also have a small, self-contained air supply which     can be used for escape if the primary supply fails.

            <Title>Respiratory Protection</Title>
            <Text>A respirator is a face piece, hood, or helmet that is designed to protect the user from a variety of harmful airborne agents. Respirators can protect you from dust and particulates in the air, hazardous vapors, oxygen deficiency, or a combination of these. Respirators are not necessary for routine operations in the engine room, but may be advisable during certain maintenance procedures such as chipping and painting.

OSHA regulations require that respirators shall be used in the following circumstances:

-   Where exposure levels exceed the *permissible exposure limit* (PEL),     during the time period necessary to install or implement feasible     engineering and work practice controls;
-   In those maintenance and repair activities and during those brief or     intermittent operations where exposures exceed the PEL and     engineering and work practice controls are not feasible or are not     required;
-   In regulated areas;
-   Where the employer has implemented all feasible engineering and work     practice controls and such controls are not sufficient to reduce     exposures to or below the PEL; and,
-   In emergencies.

Before using a respirator you should be thoroughly trained in its use. Some of the areas that you should be familiar with include: respiratory hazards; respirator selection criteria, limitations, adjustment, fit, cleaning, and storage procedures, etc. The selection of a suitable respirator depends on the hazard to which you are exposed, and the correct respirator cannot be selected without a thorough understanding of the hazard.</Text>

            <Title>Eye Protection</Title>
            <Text>Every day more than 1,000 eye injuries occur in American workplaces. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that three out of five workers who suffered eye injuries were not wearing eye protective equipment at the time of the accident, and when asked why, the victims often claimed that eye protection was not normally used in their type of work, or it was not required for the type of work performed at the time of the accident. Eye protection can save your sight, but you must be wearing it.

Eye injuries can occur in many ways, but are primarily caused by rapidly flying objects. The BLS found that almost 70% of eye injuries were caused by flying or falling objects or sparks striking the eye. Most of these objects were smaller than a pin head, and were traveling faster than a hand-thrown object. Another 20% of eye injuries were caused by chemicals, and the remainder due to miscellaneous causes such as objects swinging into the eye, pulled into the eye or by light radiation.

Eye injuries can be prevented by wearing effective eye protection. To be effective, the eyewear must be of the appropriate type for the hazard encountered and properly fitted. The BLS survey found that 94% of the injuries to workers wearing eye protection were caused by objects or chemicals going around or under the protector. Goggles provide better protection than face shields or safety glasses, but the best protection is afforded when both goggles and a face shield are worn together.</Text>

            <Text>You may be exposed to hazardous chemicals through inhalation, skin contact, or ingestion. Prolonged exposure or exposure to high concentrations can lead to adverse health effects such as respiratory issues, skin irritation, chemical burns, organ damage, or even long-term illnesses. 
You should be aware of the hazardous chemicals present in your workplace, handle them safely and take precautions to minimize exposure, such as using proper ventilation systems, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), and following established protocols.  
You can learn about the potential risks associated with a chemical, as well as instructions on how to handle and respond to accidents or exposures, in the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), which is required to be available in your workplace. MSDSs are typically created by the manufacturer or supplier of the chemical and are designed to ensure the safe use, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances.

            <Title>Hearing Protection </Title>
            <Text>Over the years, many marine engineers have suffered permanent hearing loss due to hours of exposure to the high noise levels in the engine room. You can prevent the loss of your own hearing by using proper hearing protection such as earplugs and earmuffs religiously whenever you are exposed to loud noises.

Your ear is a delicate instrument which contains thousands of fine hair cells called cilia to detect sounds. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can injure or break these cells or even tear off groups of these cells. Since the hair cells don’t ever repair themselves, when enough of them are damaged, a hearing loss results.

Short, intense, sounds such as an explosion can cause immediate and permanent hearing loss, but most hearing loss occurs gradually due to prolonged exposure to high noise levels. Most of the time this loss is so gradual that you are not even aware that it is occurring. Hearing loss is progressive and will continue to get worse as you continue to expose yourself to a noisy environment, but if you can avoid further exposure, the hearing loss won’t get any worse.

Permanent hearing loss is not the only hazard associated with noisy environments. Tinnitus is a condition where a ringing or roaring sound is heard continuously in one or both ears. Tinnitus occurs when the hair cells are damaged in such a way that they produce sound signals to the brain even in the absence of actual stimulation. This noise is sometimes described as like having a cricket permanently stuck in your ear, and is very annoying.

Sound intensity is measured in units of *decibels* (dB). The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale in which 0 dB indicates the quietest sound that can be heard by a normal person. A quiet library is about 20 dB. A normal conversation occurs at a sound level of about 60 dB. A lawnmower produces about 85 dB, and at this level you should be wearing hearing protection. Sandblasting or a rock concert has a sound intensity of about 115 dB. At this level hearing damage can occur after only about 15 minutes of unprotected exposure.

According to OSHA regulations, when the 8 hour average noise exposure is above 85 dB, employers are required to institute a noise monitoring program, provide adequate hearing protectors, and ensure employees wear them. Continual, unprotected exposure to noises louder than 85 decibels for 8 hours or more can be dangerous, and may result in hearing loss.

You can easily tell if you should be wearing hearing protection. If you find yourself in a situation where it is too noisy to carry on a conversation at arms length, or if you notice that your ears ring or feel plugged for a time after leaving a noisy environment, you can be sure that you should have been wearing your hearing protection.</Text>

            <Title>Fire </Title>
            <Text>Fire aboard ship is an ever-present threat that can swiftly escalate into a catastrophic disaster. With limited means of escape, a ship becomes a confined space where flames can spread rapidly, fueled by combustible materials and confined by its structure. 
The close quarters, complex layout, and intricate ventilation systems aboard ship create formidable challenges for the ship’s small firefighting team. In addition to the immediate threat to human lives, a shipboard fire poses a significant risk to the environment, as toxic smoke, potential oil spills, and the release of hazardous substances can wreak havoc on marine ecosystems. 
Effective fire prevention measures, comprehensive emergency response plans, rigorous training, and state-of-the-art firefighting equipment are crucial in mitigating this threat and ensuring the safety of everyone on board.
Fire prevention measures play a vital role in minimizing the risk of fire and maintaining a safe environment aboard ship. These measures encompass a range of proactive strategies aimed at preventing fires from starting or spreading. One fundamental aspect is implementing rigorous safety protocols and adhering to international standards, such as the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) regulations for fire safety.
Some key fire prevention measures include:
&lt;ul&gt;
 Regular Inspections and Maintenance. Conducting routine inspections of electrical systems, machinery, and fire suppression equipment is crucial. Identifying and addressing potential hazards, faulty wiring, or malfunctioning equipment can prevent fire incidents.
 Training and Education. Crew members should receive comprehensive training on fire safety, including proper handling of flammable substances, effective use of firefighting equipment, and emergency response procedures. Increasing awareness and knowledge among the crew can significantly reduce the likelihood of fire-related accidents.
 Fire Detection Systems. Installing advanced fire detection systems, such as smoke detectors, heat sensors, and flame detectors, helps in early detection of fires. These systems can trigger alarms, alerting the crew and initiating immediate response actions.
 Fire Suppression Systems. Equipping ships with reliable fire suppression systems, such as fixed CO2 or water mist systems, can effectively control and extinguish fires. These systems are designed to release the appropriate extinguishing agent in the affected area, limiting the fire's spread.
 Proper Storage and Handling. Storing flammable materials in designated areas and following strict protocols for their handling reduces the risk of accidental ignition. Implementing proper waste management procedures and ensuring the availability of suitable fire-resistant containers also contribute to fire prevention efforts.
 Structural Fire Protection. Regulations require fire-resistant materials and insulation in the ship's construction helps to contain fires and slow down their progression. Fire-resistant doors, bulkheads, and insulation compartmentalize the vessel, preventing the rapid spread of flames.
 Emergency Preparedness. Developing and regularly reviewing comprehensive emergency response plans specific to fire incidents is crucial. This includes establishing evacuation procedures, assigning roles and responsibilities to crew members, and conducting fire drills to ensure everyone knows how to respond swiftly and effectively in an emergency.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
By implementing robust fire prevention measures, ships can significantly reduce the risk of fire, enhance the crew's safety, and protect the marine environment from potential devastation.</Text>

            <Title>IMO Guidelines</Title>
            <Text>The IMO has developed guidelines for rest requirements to address the issue of fatigue among seafarers. These guidelines are outlined in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention). 
The STCW Convention sets out minimum hours of rest for seafarers. The standard requires that seafarers receive a minimum of 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period and a minimum of 77 hours of rest in any 7-day period. The hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, with one period being at least 6 hours in length.
In situations where the safety of the ship, crew, or passengers is compromised, and in cases of emergencies or drills, the rest period may be temporarily shortened or interrupted. However, the seafarers should be provided with compensatory rest as soon as possible.

            <Text>The most immediate and dangerous hazard of electricity is electrical shock. When a person comes into contact with an electrical current, it can pass through their body, causing electrical shock. Even low-voltage shocks can lead to muscle contractions, burns, and disruption of the body's electrical signals. High-voltage shocks can result in severe burns, organ damage, and cardiac arrest.

            <Title>Types of Safety Shoes</Title>
            <Text>**Safety Shoes and Boots.** Safety shoes and boots are available in many styles depending on the job requirements. Boots provide more protection than shoes from chemicals and molten metals splashes and spark hazards, but they are heavier. Some protective features that are available in both boots and shoes include:

-   Oil resistant shoes
-   Chemical resistant shoes
-   Heat resistant shoes
-   Slip and skid resistant shoes
-   Waterproof and water resistant shoes

**Steel-Reinforced Safety Shoes and Boots.** Similar to safety shoes, these have the toe box and insole reinforced with steel, and the instep reinforced with steel, aluminum, or plastic. These shoes will protect your feet from falling objects and puncture injuries.

**Electrically Insulated Safety Shoes.** These shoes have non-conductive soles to prevent the wearer’s feet from completing an electrical circuit to ground. They can protect workers against as much as 600 volts in dry conditions. These shoes should be used in conjunction with insulated tools and precautions to reduce or eliminate the potential for providing a path for hazardous electrical energy. Non-conductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations; in such locations, electrically conductive shoes are required.

**Electrically Conductive Safety Shoes.** These shoes protect against the buildup of static electricity. Essentially, these shoes ground the employees wearing them. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on an employee’s body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. During training, employees must be instructed not to use foot powder or wear socks made of silk, wool, or nylon with conductive shoes. Foot powder insulates and retards the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool, and nylon produce static electricity. Conductive shoes are not general-purpose shoes and must be removed upon completion of the tasks for which they are required. Employees exposed to electrical hazards must *never* wear conductive shoes.</Text>

            <Title>Arm and Hand Protection</Title>
            <Text>The National Safety Council has found that hands are the body part most frequently injured on the job. Accidents to the hand fall into these categories: abrasions, cuts, punctures, crushes, contact with moving machinery, burns, and chemical injuries. Gloves and hand protection are available to protect you from nearly all of these hazards. However, glove selection must be based on performance characteristics of the gloves, conditions, durations of use, and hazards present. One type of glove will not work in all situations.

In the engine room, particular hazards include high temperatures and moving machinery. Long sleeved shirts are advisable to protect your arms, and you should always have a pair of work gloves available to use when necessary to protect your hands when working around hot pipes. Special high temperature gloves should always be worn when changing burners, and the appropriate chemical resistant gloves should be worn when working with burner cleaning and boiler chemicals. You should also pay particular attention to avoid contact with moving parts of machinery or power tools with moving parts, and insure that safety guards are always in place. Gloves should always be inspected for damage before use.</Text>

            <Title>Foot Protection</Title>
            <Text>Your feet are vulnerable to many potential hazards aboard ship. For example, slips and falls due to wet and slippery decks; heavy objects falling on or rolling over your foot because of the ship’s motion or accident; punctures caused by stepping on sharp objects; and potential electrical shock when your body is grounded through the soles of your shoes. In other industries, there are other hazards to consider, chemical exposure, high temperatures, molten metal splashes, static electricity, to name a few. Proper selection of footwear can minimize the danger of these hazards.

OSHA has established regulations for safety shoe design, including impact and compression strength requirements, and they have mandated footwear requirements for many industries. For example, safety shoes or boots with impact protection are required to be worn in work areas where carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection are required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual materials handling cars) or other activities in which materials or equipment could potentially roll over an employee’s feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection are required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a foot injury. Although there are no specific OSHA requirements for safety footwear for marine engineers, it is nonetheless sensible to select and wear safety shoes based on the hazards found in the engine room.</Text>

            <Title>Safety Glasses</Title>
            <Text>**Safety Glasses.** Safety glasses are lightweight glasses that have shatter resistant lenses made of materials like polycarbonate or propionate plastic and often have side shields attached to the side pieces. Safety glasses are designed to stop flying objects such as chips, fragments, sand, and dirt from injuring your eyes. They also can provide laser light filtration to prevent reflections from the laser entering the eye and causing retinal burns. Safety glasses can be purchased with prescription lenses including bifocals if necessary.

The main advantage of safety glasses is that they are lightweight and relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The provide little to no protection from liquids or vapors, and some flying particles may get around the side shields.

            <Title>Respiratory Protection</Title>
            <Text>A respirator is a face piece, hood, or helmet that is designed to protect the user from a variety of harmful airborne agents. Respirators can protect you from dust and particulates in the air, hazardous vapors, oxygen deficiency, or a combination of these. Respirators are not necessary for routine operations in the engine room, but may be advisable during certain maintenance procedures such as chipping and painting.

OSHA regulations require that respirators shall be used in the following circumstances:

-   Where exposure levels exceed the *permissible exposure limit* (PEL),     during the time period necessary to install or implement feasible     engineering and work practice controls;
-   In those maintenance and repair activities and during those brief or     intermittent operations where exposures exceed the PEL and     engineering and work practice controls are not feasible or are not     required;
-   In regulated areas;
-   Where the employer has implemented all feasible engineering and work     practice controls and such controls are not sufficient to reduce     exposures to or below the PEL; and,
-   In emergencies.

Before using a respirator you should be thoroughly trained in its use. Some of the areas that you should be familiar with include: respiratory hazards; respirator selection criteria, limitations, adjustment, fit, cleaning, and storage procedures, etc. The selection of a suitable respirator depends on the hazard to which you are exposed, and the correct respirator cannot be selected without a thorough understanding of the hazard.</Text>

            <Text>Head injuries are caused by falling or flying objects, or by bumping your head against a fixed object. Head protection, in the form of protective hats, must do two things – resist penetration and absorb the shock of the blow. This is accomplished by making the shell of the hat of a material hard enough to resist the blow, and by utilizing a shock-absorbing lining composed of headband and crown straps to keep the shell away from the wearer’s skull. Protective hats are also used to protect against electric shock.</Text>

            <Title>Types of Hearing Protectors</Title>
            <Text>**Figure 9.3. Types of Hearing Protection**

Fig: ppe/Hearing_Protection.png "Types of Hearing Protection" class=left

**Disposable foam plugs.** Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each person’s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better.

**Reusable, pre-molded plugs.** Pre-molded plugs are made from silicone, plastic or rubber and are manufactured as either “one-size-fits-most” or are available in several sizes. Be sure to choose the proper size for your ear canals. In some cases, different size plugs may be required for each ear. The advantage of pre-molded plugs are that they are inexpensive, reusable, washable, convenient to carry, and come in a variety of sizes. Nearly everyone can find a plug that will be comfortable and effective. Another advantage is that in a dirty environment like the engine room, you don’t need to handle or roll the tips. You insert this type of plug by reaching over your head with one hand to pull up on your ear. Then use your other hand to insert the plug with a gentle rocking motion until you have sealed the ear canal.

**Hearing Bands.** Hearing Bands, also called canal caps or semi-insert devices often resemble earplugs on a flexible plastic or metal band. The earplug tips of a canal cap may be a formable or pre-molded material. Some have headbands that can be worn over the head, behind the neck or under the chin. The main advantage of canal caps is their convenience They are easy to put on and take off . When it’s quiet, employees can leave the band hanging around their necks, but they can quickly insert the plug tips when hazardous noise starts again. These devices are ideal for intermittent use, but they provide less protection then either plugs or muffs. Some people find the pressure from the bands uncomfortable.

&gt;**What is a Decibel?**

&gt;The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first let’s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power *P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*, and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power *P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*, but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* dB where the log is to base 10. If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 2 = 3 dB. If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 10 = 10 dB. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 1,000,000 = 60 dB. This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size.

&gt;Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, *p*. The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of *x* is just 2 log *x*, this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with *p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*and *p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* is defined as: 20 log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) dB where the log is to base 10. This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. (This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers (Walkmans) are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries.) So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that 20 log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) = 86 dB where *p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;* is the sound pressure of the reference level, and *p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) = 4.3 dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long.

&gt;What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level = 20 log (*p*&lt;sub&gt;measured&lt;/sub&gt; /*p*&lt;sub&gt;reference&lt;/sub&gt; ) = 20 log 1 = 0 dB. So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals.</Text>

            <Text>Mechanical hazards are a physical hazards associated with machines and other movable objects that may cause harm to a person.
Injuries caused by mechanical hazards include friction or abrasion, lacerations, cutting, severing, pinching, crushing, or entanglement of body parts. Additionally, non-mechanical hazards such as chips, splashes, and sparks can injure you or others in the area.
Mechanical hazards can be managed by adopting safe work procedures and the application of appropriate safeguards. As such, you should always wear appropriate PPE, follow the machine’s operating instructions, and ensure that all machine safety features and guards are in place. Be aware that some machines may start automatically at any time, so take appropriate precautions including de-energizing and locking out machinery before working on it.</Text>

            <Text>A job hazard analysis (JHA), also known as a job safety analysis (JSA), is a systematic process used to identify and analyze potential hazards or risks associated with specific job tasks or activities. Its primary purpose is to reduce the risk of accidents by identifying potential hazards and developing appropriate controls to mitigate them.
The process typically involves breaking down a job into its individual steps  and examining each step to identify potential hazards. Hazards can include physical hazards (e.g., machinery, equipment, or environmental conditions), chemical hazards (e.g., exposure to hazardous substances), biological hazards (e.g., exposure to infectious agents), ergonomic hazards (e.g., repetitive motion or lifting heavy objects), or any other factors that could pose a risk to worker safety and health.
The key steps in conducting a job hazard analysis typically include: 
&lt;ol&gt;
Select the job or task to be analyzed.
 Break down the job into steps.
 Identify potential hazards for each step.
 Determine the risk level for each identified hazard.  Risk level multiplies severity and the likelihood of each identified hazard.
 Develop hazard controls to eliminate or minimize the hazards. This might include engineering controls (e.g., machine guarding), administrative controls (e.g., training or procedures), or personal protective equipment (PPE)
 Communicate the findings to workers and stakeholders to ensure awareness and buy-in.
Regularly review and update the job hazard analysis.
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This results of the JHA can be shared with the crew during a toolbox talk in order to raise awareness about known hazards, reinforce safe work practices, and promote a culture of safety. These talks are usually conducted before the start of the work day.
Systematically analyzing and communicating job hazards and implementing appropriate controls helps to create a safer workplace.

            <Text>OSHA divides respirators into two categories:

Fig: ppe/respirators1.jpg "Air-purifying respirator" class=right

**Air-purifying Respirators.** These units have filters, cartridges, or canisters that remove contaminants from the air by passing the air through the air-purifying element before it reaches the user. Air purifying respirators are further divided into:

-   *Particulate Respirators*, which capture particles such as dusts,     paint fumes, and mists, but do not protect against gases and vapors.     The filters in particulate respirators generally work better as     particles accumulate on the filter. If the filter becomes so clogged     that it is difficult to breathe, it should be replaced.

-   *Gas and Vapor Respirators*, which use a chemical cartridge or     canister to remove dangerous gases or vapors, but which do not     protect against airborne particles. These units only protect against     specific gases or vapors, and only provide protection as long as the     filter’s absorbing capacity remains.

-   *Combination Respirators*, which can be used in atmospheres that     contain both hazardous gases and particles.

Fig: ppe/respirators2.jpg "Atmosphere-supplying respirators" class=right

**Atmosphere-supplying Respirators.** These units supply clean air directly to the user from a source other than the air surrounding the user. The types of air-supplying respirators are:

-   *Air Supplied Respirators*, which have a hose which connects to a     source of clean air under pressure. These units have no time limit on the air supply, but the hose limits the range and mobility of the user and is susceptible to damage.

-   *Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus*, which have a wearable     clean-air supply pack. These units have better mobility than the air-supplied respirator, but the clean air time is limited to the     capacity of the tank.

-   *Combination Respirators*, which are similar to the air-supplied     respirators, but also have a small, self-contained air supply which     can be used for escape if the primary supply fails.

            <Title>Arm and Hand Protection</Title>
            <Text>The National Safety Council has found that hands are the body part most frequently injured on the job. Accidents to the hand fall into these categories: abrasions, cuts, punctures, crushes, contact with moving machinery, burns, and chemical injuries. Gloves and hand protection are available to protect you from nearly all of these hazards. However, glove selection must be based on performance characteristics of the gloves, conditions, durations of use, and hazards present. One type of glove will not work in all situations.

In the engine room, particular hazards include high temperatures and moving machinery. Long sleeved shirts are advisable to protect your arms, and you should always have a pair of work gloves available to use when necessary to protect your hands when working around hot pipes. Special high temperature gloves should always be worn when changing burners, and the appropriate chemical resistant gloves should be worn when working with burner cleaning and boiler chemicals. You should also pay particular attention to avoid contact with moving parts of machinery or power tools with moving parts, and insure that safety guards are always in place. Gloves should always be inspected for damage before use.</Text>

            <Text>The goal of this template is make the composition and drafting phase of a LaTeX-based project as simple and elegant as possible. It is not meant to turn Scrivener, a rich text editor, into a full-blown LaTeX generator (you'll need to use MultiMarkdown or Pandoc for that; consider using the General Non-Fiction template if that is what you are looking for). Instead, this project contains a number of convenience features that could be applied to your work as you wish in an à la carte fashion, to alleviate how much code you'd need to type in yourself. For example, if you find handling images to be cumbersome in LaTeX, you can safely leave that up to the template.

When compiled (File&gt;Compile…), this project will generate a bare bones .tex document (using the flexible Memoir class) suitable for many types of work, fiction and non-fiction alike. The template achieves this by using advanced features available to the Plain Text compile file type, including providing the default extension of “.tex” instead of “.txt”. From that basic start you could build your own document design, or just as easily swap out the preamble components for something else entirely.

Foremost, this template caters to those that prefer, or perhaps are required, to compose directly in LaTeX itself, and will be approaching Scrivener primarily as an organisational and composition tool for constructing a longer .tex file from the many smaller snippets written into the Draft folder.</Text>

            <Text>Always wear a welding helmet when arc welding. Your eyes, face, and neck need protection against the burning rays of the arc, and from the splatter of molten metal and slag. To protect your eyesight, make sure the welding helmet has a colored lens with at least a No. 10 shade when welding with 200 amperes or less. And never strike a welding arc before your helmet is in place. Never look at an arc from any distance with your naked eyes while someone else is welding.

Never chip slag when your eyes (or those of others nearby) are not protected by goggles, an eye shield, or the clear lens of a welding helmet. If fragments of hot slag were to hit the eye, medical attention would be required for their removal, and blindness could result. The risk of permanent eye injury is so great that you should never chip slag from a weld without protecting your eyes.</Text>

Confined spaces pose several hazards that can endanger workers who enter  them due to their limited entry and exit points, restricted airflow, and potential for hazardous atmospheres. 
On ships, some examples of confined spaces include:  Cargo and fuel tanks, cofferdams, pressure vessels, sewage tanks, and void spaces.

            <Title>Personal Survival Equipment</Title>
            <Text>A ship or boat has many of the same hazards found in shoreside workplaces, but in addition it has the danger of drowning. Fortunately, ships are equipped with several specialized pieces of safety equipment designed to help protect you in the watery environment. These include: life preservers, work vests, immersion suits, and thermal protective aids.

Fig: ppe/pfdti.png "Type I PFD"class=left

The main function of any PFD, of course, is to keep a person afloat, or buoyant-even with heavy clothes and gear. Its buoyancy also helps a stranded person save energy, because without a PFD a swimmer has to continually work to stay afloat. Some designs also help keep a victim’s face out of the water. A PFD’s buoyancy is the amount of weight it can keep afloat. High buoyancy is over 20 pounds. This may sound low, but water provides lift, so the average adult needs only 7 to 12 pounds of buoyancy.

A PFD can only save your life if it is available when you need it, and you wear it properly. Be sure you know where you keep your own life preserver and also where the spare PFD’s are stowed in the engine room. Use the opportunity at weekly boat drills to practice donning your life jacket, and inspect it frequently for tears and open seams; for lost buoyant material; for waterlogged, oil-soaked, or hardened buoyant material; and for proper functioning of the light and whistle.

**Type I life preserver.** This it the type of life preserver which is used by all hands aboard merchant ships. Every cadet is given instruction in its use during *STCW Basic Safety Training* during orientation.

The Type I life preserver is an international orange colored vest filled with a sufficient amount of inherently buoyant material to give it 22 pounds of buoyancy, and fitted with straps to hold it in position on the wearer. The PFD is equipped with a whistle for attracting attention, and reflective tape and a light to make it more visible at night. Because of its high buoyancy, it is bulky and not normally worn continuously while working.

**Type V PFD Work Vest.** This is a “one size fits all” work vest which provides basic flotation for workers who fall in the water. It is intended for people working in exposed locations over the water or near the edge of the deck, and also for deck crews on tugs and barges. It is assumed that rescue will occur quickly. A work vest is only approved for use consistent with its design.

The main advantage of a work vest is that is has relatively little bulk and does not significantly restrict the wearers movement, making it suitable for continuous wear. It is less buoyant than a Type I PFD and will not hold an unconscious wearer’s face clear of the water. Because it has less buoyancy a conscious wearer’s face may also be covered by waves in rough water.

**Immersion Suit.** Immersion suits, also known as survival suits or “gumby suits,” are a full body, insulated flotation device which can protect you from hypothermia and prevent you from drowning. Because hypothermia is a major factor in lives lost at sea, the U.S. Coast Guard now requires immersion suits on all documented vessels operating north of 32 degrees N and seaward of the Coastal Boundary Line.

Fig: ppe/gumby.png "Immersion Suit" class=right

Hypothermia, the lowering of a person’s core body temperature, can quickly kill anyone who ends up in the water for too long. A person’s survival time in the water depends on several factors including water temperature, the person’s body mass and build, and the insulating properties of his garments. Unprotected, a person will rapidly lose heat in cold water and can die in a matter of minutes. The insulated immersion suit can significantly improve survival time by reducing body heat loss to the water.

A typical immersion suit is made of bright international orange neoprene of sufficient buoyancy to keep you afloat, with a full-length zipper, face seal and flap, integral boots and mittens, and an inflatable head support. The Coast Guard requires all suits to be marked with 31 square inches of retro-reflective tape which improves your visibility and chances of being picked up. A whistle and strobe light are also required on ocean going vessels. Suits must be equipped with a Coast Guard Approved light which should be attached to the shoulder area. Suits must also be marked in “block capital letters” with the vessel name, and the name of the owner of the suit or the name of the person to whom the suit is assigned.

Proper care and maintenance of immersion suits will extend their working life and possibly your own. Routine suit inspections should include suit material and function of zippers and inflation hoses. Inspect for holes, tears or signs of wear. Suits used in salt water or in pools should be rinsed thoroughly inside and out with fresh water and turned inside out to dry, but not in direct sunlight. Grease and oil should be removed from suits with mild soap. Do not dry clean. Check all zippers for smooth operation. Lubricate zippers with a non-petroleum based product such as canning paraffin, beeswax or substance recommended by the manufacturer. Air bladders provide extra buoyancy and are vitally important in keeping the head out of water when lying horizontally in the water. At least once a year the bladder and inflation hose should be checked.

Store your suit in an accessible and dry place. Suits should be rolled and stowed in their bags with the zippers open and zipped up one inch from the bottom. Lubricate snaps and zippers on the bag.

Your immersion suit works properly only when you are wearing it in the water. Safety regulations for documented vessels that operate beyond the boundary lines or with more than 16 people, require monthly drills and instructions for donning immersion suits. First attempts can be awkward and exhausting but with practice you should succeed in getting into a suit in one minute or less. Practice seated donning of suit. This will be the most convenient methods in an actual high sea, emergency situation.


The following are the instructions for practice seated donning of an immersion suit:

1.  Roll suit out on deck and sit on it. Insert your legs into suit     using plastic bags to make it easier. Leave on boots and other     clothing for insulation and protection in the water.

2.  Place non-dominant arm into suit first (lefties-right and     righties-left). Pull hood over head with free hand.

3.  Place dominant arm in last. Pull the zipper up with care and secure     flap over your face.

4.  Make sure that all straps and hoses are secure to avoid being     snagged or injured. Do not inflate air bladder until you are in the     water.

**Thermal Protective Aids (TPA).** The Thermal Protective Aid (TPA) is an indispensable piece of survival gear. The TPA is a windproof, waterproof sack with arms and a hood, made of aluminized polyethylene similar to a space blanket. It is colored bright international orange, with reflective strips to make the it highly visible in all weather conditions. All SOLAS liferafts are required to carry enough TPAs for 10% of the rated crew capacity of the liferaft, or at least two per liferaft.

Fig: ppe/tpa.png "Thermal Protective Aid" width=300px

When worn, the TPA will protect you from exposure and low temperatures. Although it is not as effective as an immersion suit and provides no flotation, it is easy to don, compact to store, and its space blanket effect can prevent hypothermia by cutting down your heat loss from radiation and convection. Unfortunately, if you are immersed in the water, the suit will provide little insulation to heat loss by conduction, but it can save your life if you can get out of the water. </Text>

Head protection, in the form of protective hats, must do two things – resist penetration and absorb the shock of the blow. This is accomplished by making the shell of the hat of a material hard enough to resist the blow, and by utilizing a shock-absorbing lining composed of headband and crown straps to keep the shell away from the wearer’s skull. Protective hats are also used to protect against electric shock.</Text>

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Using Section Types: examples of this approach include the figure, table and equation setups. These are comprised of the following ingredients:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{} A “Section Type” that can be used to flag items in your binder as needing to be associated with a particular environment. If you look at the Table document template, you will see that in the Metadata inspector pane, it has been assigned to the “Table” section type.

\item{} A “Section Layout” in the compile format settings is what does the heavy lifting. Edit the Format for this project by going to File ▸ Compile…, right-click on the project template's Format in the left sidebar to edit it, and in the “Section Layouts” pane, examine the “Table w/ Captions” layout. The prefix and suffix tabs for this layout are where the actual LaTeX code will be inserted around the text you type in the editor.
\end{enumerate}

\item{} Using Styles: when environments are more likely to be found within a longer chunk of text, and would not be so useful broken out into their own sections, styles can also be used to insert a prefix and suffix around the text you type. The “Block Quote” or even “Emphasis” styles serve as examples of how this can be done. Visit the “Styles” pane in the compile format settings to examine how prefixes and suffixes are used with them.

Assess the object's weight and plan your lift accordingly. Warm up your muscles with light exercises. Stand close to the object with feet shoulder-width apart, keeping your back straight and bending at the knees. Get a firm grip on the object and lift using the strength of your legs, not your back. Avoid twisting and keep the object close to your body. 
Don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Prioritize safety and listen to your body to prevent injuries.</Text>

            <Title>Personal Survival Equipment</Title>
            <Text>A ship or boat has many of the same hazards found in shoreside workplaces, but in addition it has the danger of drowning. Fortunately, ships are equipped with several specialized pieces of safety equipment designed to help protect you in the watery environment. These include: life preservers, work vests, immersion suits, and thermal protective aids.

Fig: ppe/pfdti.png "Type I PFD"class=left

The main function of any PFD, of course, is to keep a person afloat, or buoyant-even with heavy clothes and gear. Its buoyancy also helps a stranded person save energy, because without a PFD a swimmer has to continually work to stay afloat. Some designs also help keep a victim’s face out of the water. A PFD’s buoyancy is the amount of weight it can keep afloat. High buoyancy is over 20 pounds. This may sound low, but water provides lift, so the average adult needs only 7 to 12 pounds of buoyancy.

A PFD can only save your life if it is available when you need it, and you wear it properly. Be sure you know where you keep your own life preserver and also where the spare PFD’s are stowed in the engine room. Use the opportunity at weekly boat drills to practice donning your life jacket, and inspect it frequently for tears and open seams; for lost buoyant material; for waterlogged, oil-soaked, or hardened buoyant material; and for proper functioning of the light and whistle.

**Type I life preserver.** This it the type of life preserver which is used by all hands aboard merchant ships. Every cadet is given instruction in its use during *STCW Basic Safety Training* during orientation.

The Type I life preserver is an international orange colored vest filled with a sufficient amount of inherently buoyant material to give it 22 pounds of buoyancy, and fitted with straps to hold it in position on the wearer. The PFD is equipped with a whistle for attracting attention, and reflective tape and a light to make it more visible at night. Because of its high buoyancy, it is bulky and not normally worn continuously while working.

**Type V PFD Work Vest.** This is a “one size fits all” work vest which provides basic flotation for workers who fall in the water. It is intended for people working in exposed locations over the water or near the edge of the deck, and also for deck crews on tugs and barges. It is assumed that rescue will occur quickly. A work vest is only approved for use consistent with its design.

The main advantage of a work vest is that is has relatively little bulk and does not significantly restrict the wearers movement, making it suitable for continuous wear. It is less buoyant than a Type I PFD and will not hold an unconscious wearer’s face clear of the water. Because it has less buoyancy a conscious wearer’s face may also be covered by waves in rough water.

**Immersion Suit.** Immersion suits, also known as survival suits or “gumby suits,” are a full body, insulated flotation device which can protect you from hypothermia and prevent you from drowning. Because hypothermia is a major factor in lives lost at sea, the U.S. Coast Guard now requires immersion suits on all documented vessels operating north of 32 degrees N and seaward of the Coastal Boundary Line.

Fig: ppe/gumby.png "Immersion Suit" class=right

Hypothermia, the lowering of a person’s core body temperature, can quickly kill anyone who ends up in the water for too long. A person’s survival time in the water depends on several factors including water temperature, the person’s body mass and build, and the insulating properties of his garments. Unprotected, a person will rapidly lose heat in cold water and can die in a matter of minutes. The insulated immersion suit can significantly improve survival time by reducing body heat loss to the water.

A typical immersion suit is made of bright international orange neoprene of sufficient buoyancy to keep you afloat, with a full-length zipper, face seal and flap, integral boots and mittens, and an inflatable head support. The Coast Guard requires all suits to be marked with 31 square inches of retro-reflective tape which improves your visibility and chances of being picked up. A whistle and strobe light are also required on ocean going vessels. Suits must be equipped with a Coast Guard Approved light which should be attached to the shoulder area. Suits must also be marked in “block capital letters” with the vessel name, and the name of the owner of the suit or the name of the person to whom the suit is assigned.

Proper care and maintenance of immersion suits will extend their working life and possibly your own. Routine suit inspections should include suit material and function of zippers and inflation hoses. Inspect for holes, tears or signs of wear. Suits used in salt water or in pools should be rinsed thoroughly inside and out with fresh water and turned inside out to dry, but not in direct sunlight. Grease and oil should be removed from suits with mild soap. Do not dry clean. Check all zippers for smooth operation. Lubricate zippers with a non-petroleum based product such as canning paraffin, beeswax or substance recommended by the manufacturer. Air bladders provide extra buoyancy and are vitally important in keeping the head out of water when lying horizontally in the water. At least once a year the bladder and inflation hose should be checked.

Store your suit in an accessible and dry place. Suits should be rolled and stowed in their bags with the zippers open and zipped up one inch from the bottom. Lubricate snaps and zippers on the bag.

Your immersion suit works properly only when you are wearing it in the water. Safety regulations for documented vessels that operate beyond the boundary lines or with more than 16 people, require monthly drills and instructions for donning immersion suits. First attempts can be awkward and exhausting but with practice you should succeed in getting into a suit in one minute or less. Practice seated donning of suit. This will be the most convenient methods in an actual high sea, emergency situation.


The following are the instructions for practice seated donning of an immersion suit:

1.  Roll suit out on deck and sit on it. Insert your legs into suit     using plastic bags to make it easier. Leave on boots and other     clothing for insulation and protection in the water.

2.  Place non-dominant arm into suit first (lefties-right and     righties-left). Pull hood over head with free hand.

3.  Place dominant arm in last. Pull the zipper up with care and secure     flap over your face.

4.  Make sure that all straps and hoses are secure to avoid being     snagged or injured. Do not inflate air bladder until you are in the     water.

**Thermal Protective Aids (TPA).** The Thermal Protective Aid (TPA) is an indispensable piece of survival gear. The TPA is a windproof, waterproof sack with arms and a hood, made of aluminized polyethylene similar to a space blanket. It is colored bright international orange, with reflective strips to make the it highly visible in all weather conditions. All SOLAS liferafts are required to carry enough TPAs for 10% of the rated crew capacity of the liferaft, or at least two per liferaft.

Fig: ppe/tpa.png "Thermal Protective Aid" width=300px

When worn, the TPA will protect you from exposure and low temperatures. Although it is not as effective as an immersion suit and provides no flotation, it is easy to don, compact to store, and its space blanket effect can prevent hypothermia by cutting down your heat loss from radiation and convection. Unfortunately, if you are immersed in the water, the suit will provide little insulation to heat loss by conduction, but it can save your life if you can get out of the water. </Text>

            <Title>Safety Glasses</Title>
            <Text>Safety glasses are lightweight glasses that have shatter resistant lenses made of materials like polycarbonate or propionate plastic and often have side shields attached to the side pieces. Safety glasses are designed to stop flying objects such as chips, fragments, sand, and dirt from injuring your eyes. They also can provide laser light filtration to prevent reflections from the laser entering the eye and causing retinal burns. Safety glasses can be purchased with prescription lenses including bifocals if necessary.
The main advantage of safety glasses is that they are lightweight and relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The provide little to no protection from liquids or vapors, and some flying particles may get around the side shields.

            <Title>Slips, trips and falls</Title>
            <Text>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, slips, trips, and falls cause nearly 700 fatalities per year and many more injurious accidents in the workplace,
Common trip and fall hazards include obstructions on walkways, such as cables, tools, or equipment left in pathways. Uneven surfaces, loose gratings, and obstructions, can also contribute to tripping incidents. Additionally, poor lighting, cluttered work areas, improper storage of materials, and inadequate lighting can increase the risk of trips and falls.  
Spilled liquids, oils, or water can make surfaces extremely slippery. Wet surfaces due to cleaning or maintenance activities, and the presence of loose debris are additional factors that can contribute to slip incidents.
Falls can be particularly dangerous when you are working at above the ground, such as on a ladder, scaffolding or staging.
Falling objects such as tools, equipment, materials, or debris can potentially cause serious injuries or fatalities.  When tools and are stored haphazardly or left unsecured, they are susceptible to falling on someone. 
Aboard ship, additional hazards exist due to the dynamic and often wet environment. Obstructions such as hatch combings, pad-eyes and container hold-downs can cause individuals to trip. Slip hazards arise from seawater or rainwater on deck surfaces, spilled liquids in galley areas, or lubricants used for machinery maintenance.  In rough seas, the motion of the ship can cause unsecured objects to fall, or cause you to lose your balance and fall. You must be particularly careful when working at heights or over the side. Always follow the old adage, “one hand for the ship and one hand for yourself.</Text>

            <Text>The safety hat or cap in Class C is designed specifically for lightweight comfort and impact protection and is sometimes known as a bump cap. Class C helmets are used on occasions where there is a possibility of bumping the head against a fixed object and no danger from falling objects or electrical shock. Bump caps can be worn for protection against scalp lacerations from contact with sharp objects. However, they are not substitutes for safety caps/hats because they do not afford protection from high impact forces or penetration by falling objects.</Text>

            <Text>**Figure 9.3. Types of Hearing Protection**

Fig: ppe/Hearing_Protection.png "Types of Hearing Protection" class=left

**Disposable foam plugs.** Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each person’s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better.

**Reusable, pre-molded plugs.** Pre-molded plugs are made from silicone, plastic or rubber and are manufactured as either “one-size-fits-most” or are available in several sizes. Be sure to choose the proper size for your ear canals. In some cases, different size plugs may be required for each ear. The advantage of pre-molded plugs are that they are inexpensive, reusable, washable, convenient to carry, and come in a variety of sizes. Nearly everyone can find a plug that will be comfortable and effective. Another advantage is that in a dirty environment like the engine room, you don’t need to handle or roll the tips. You insert this type of plug by reaching over your head with one hand to pull up on your ear. Then use your other hand to insert the plug with a gentle rocking motion until you have sealed the ear canal.

**Hearing Bands.** Hearing Bands, also called canal caps or semi-insert devices often resemble earplugs on a flexible plastic or metal band. The earplug tips of a canal cap may be a formable or pre-molded material. Some have headbands that can be worn over the head, behind the neck or under the chin. The main advantage of canal caps is their convenience They are easy to put on and take off . When it’s quiet, employees can leave the band hanging around their necks, but they can quickly insert the plug tips when hazardous noise starts again. These devices are ideal for intermittent use, but they provide less protection then either plugs or muffs. Some people find the pressure from the bands uncomfortable.

&gt;**What is a Decibel?**

&gt;The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first let’s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power *P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*, and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power *P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*, but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* dB where the log is to base 10. If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 2 = 3 dB. If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 10 = 10 dB. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 1,000,000 = 60 dB. This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size.

&gt;Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, *p*. The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of *x* is just 2 log *x*, this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with *p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*and *p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* is defined as: 20 log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) dB where the log is to base 10. This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. (This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers (Walkmans) are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries.) So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that 20 log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) = 86 dB where *p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;* is the sound pressure of the reference level, and *p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) = 4.3 dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long.

&gt;What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level = 20 log (*p*&lt;sub&gt;measured&lt;/sub&gt; /*p*&lt;sub&gt;reference&lt;/sub&gt; ) = 20 log 1 = 0 dB. So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals.</Text>

            <Title>Types of Safety Shoes</Title>
            <Text>**Safety Shoes and Boots.** Safety shoes and boots are available in many styles depending on the job requirements. Boots provide more protection than shoes from chemicals and molten metals splashes and spark hazards, but they are heavier. Some protective features that are available in both boots and shoes include:

-   Oil resistant shoes
-   Chemical resistant shoes
-   Heat resistant shoes
-   Slip and skid resistant shoes
-   Waterproof and water resistant shoes

**Steel-Reinforced Safety Shoes and Boots.** Similar to safety shoes, these have the toe box and insole reinforced with steel, and the instep reinforced with steel, aluminum, or plastic. These shoes will protect your feet from falling objects and puncture injuries.

**Electrically Insulated Safety Shoes.** These shoes have non-conductive soles to prevent the wearer’s feet from completing an electrical circuit to ground. They can protect workers against as much as 600 volts in dry conditions. These shoes should be used in conjunction with insulated tools and precautions to reduce or eliminate the potential for providing a path for hazardous electrical energy. Non-conductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations; in such locations, electrically conductive shoes are required.

**Electrically Conductive Safety Shoes.** These shoes protect against the buildup of static electricity. Essentially, these shoes ground the employees wearing them. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on an employee’s body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. During training, employees must be instructed not to use foot powder or wear socks made of silk, wool, or nylon with conductive shoes. Foot powder insulates and retards the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool, and nylon produce static electricity. Conductive shoes are not general-purpose shoes and must be removed upon completion of the tasks for which they are required. Employees exposed to electrical hazards must *never* wear conductive shoes.</Text>

            <Text>General Non-Fiction (LATEX)
About This Template
The goal of this template is make the composition and drafting phase as simple and elegant as possible. It is not meant to turn Scrivener, a rich text editor, into a full-blown LaTeX generator (you'll need to use MultiMarkdown or Pandoc for that; consider using the General Non-Fiction template if that is what you are looking for). Instead, this project contains a number of convenience features that could be applied to your work as you wish in an à la carte fashion, to alleviate how much code you'd need to type in yourself. For example, if you find handling images to be cumbersome in LaTeX, you can safely leave that up to the template.
This template caters to those that by and large prefer to compose directly in LaTeX itself, and will be approaching Scrivener primarily as an organisational and composition tool for constructing a longer .tex file from the smaller snippets written into the Draft folder.
When compiled (File ▸ Compile…), this project will generate a bare bones .tex document (using the flexible Memoir class) suitable for many types of work, fiction and non-fiction alike. The template achieves this by using advanced features available to the Plain Text compile file type, including providing the default extension of ".tex" instead of ".txt".
How To Use This Template
	◆	Inside the “Draft” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. (LaTeX itself will of course handle all numbering schemes.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
	◆	Create a new text document for each section inside the chapter folders. Sections will be numbered and titled by LaTeX using hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
	◦	Nest documents beneath documents to create numbered subsections, subsubsections and unnumbered paragraphs, at 3rd, 4th and 5th levels of hierarchy respectively.
	◦	You can of course also nest folders if you prefer.
	◆	If you need to create the occasional unnumbered section, the Informal Chapter and Informal Section Types can be manually applied to those sections.
	◆	If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document in the Front Matter folder to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface”, “Abstract” or “Introduction” as you require. Adjust the title, table of contents and other front matter material within this folder, placing any additional front matter sections between the “Begin Document” and “Begin Main Matter” items.
	◆	“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents ▸ Change Icon feature).
General Writing Tips
Foremost, any LaTeX you type in yourself will be dutifully conveyed to the output. As such, you can treat the main editor in Scrivener much like you would a dedicated text editor such as TeXShop. You may still prefer to use another editor to construct LaTeX syntax more easily, or take advantage of the syntax highlighting these types of editors can afford. Simply copy and paste the results of your writings into Scrivener when you’re ready to “save” them.
Adjusting Outline Structure
Scrivener is designed so that you can use the Draft outline flexibly. The default settings for this template are set up to consider all items at the first level within the draft as chapters. Beneath that, all items will be considered sections, subsections and so on down to the \paragraph environment. To adjust these settings, use the Project ▸ Project Settings… menu command, click on the “Section Types” pane, and then the “Default Types by Structure” tab. For example, if you wanted the top level of the Draft to use parts instead of chapters, you could select “Part” (which has already been set up for you) for the Level 1 assignments, and then adjust all greater levels of depth accordingly.
It is also worth noting that under default settings, if you omit a title for a binder item it will become "anonymous", not producing any title material and by extension opting out of being a part of the formal structure of the document as compiled. You could also manually assign an item to the “N/A” section type to cause it to be printed as-is, if you would prefer to give it an casual outlining title.
Compiling
	◆	The “Front Matter” folder contains some example preamble of the sort that would follow the more rudimentary setup of the document's overall look and feel (that is delegated to the compile Format itself, making it possible to create your own target formats and switch document classes with a single click).
	◆	A “Back Matter” folder is also provided. Here you can add any back matter you wish to include before the final \end{document} command. Nothing provided in this folder is necessary for a simple document to be typeset.  An example structure has been provided for including an appendix. The folder itself is assigned to the "Appendix" Section Type, which is responsible for titling the section and then starting the formal appendix portion of the document. Within that folder the ordinary structural rules for the Draft folder will be adhered to, meaning you can construct complex appendices with sections, subsections and so forth, based on the hierarchy of the outline. If you do not need an appendix, you can remove this folder.
To compile:
	1.	Go to File ▸ Compile…
	2.	Next to “Compile for”, select “Plain Text (.txt)”.
	3.	Select the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format on the left.
	4.	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right. If you do not do this the resulting .tex file will not properly typeset until the example material has been copied to an area included in the compile (such as the top of the Draft folder). The “Add back matter” feature is optional.
	5.	Click on Compile, open the .tex file in your preferred editor and typeset the document.
To compile directly to PDF:
	1.	Go to File ▸ Compile…
	2.	Double-click the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format to edit it.
	3.	Click on the Processing compile format pane.
	4.	Enable the “Post-Process on command-line” option to enable the built-in script.
	5.	Optional: click the “Edit Script” button and review the script for any changes you would like to make. The script is set up to use XeLaTeX, you might prefer to use the -pdf switch instead, for pdflatex output.
	6.	Optional: ensure that the Environment field includes the path to your texbin (for example “/Library/TeX/texbin”, as set up by MacTex).
	7.	Click the Save button, and then Compile. Note you will be supplying the name of the intermediary .tex file. The .pdf will use the base name, so “something.tex” will become “something.pdf” in the end.
To create your own document class variation:
	1.	Go to File ▸ Compile…
	2.	Right-click on the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format on the left, and select Duplicate &amp; Edit Format….
	3.	Rename the format at the top to match your intended edits.
	4.	Click on the Text Layout compile format preference pane.
	5.	Modify the prefix and suffix fields to include you preferred preamble and footer.
	6.	Since some of the LaTeX code used elsewhere in the settings may require adjustment to work outside of Memoir, you might need to audit the rest of the format's panes and content therein.
	7.	Click on Save.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.
Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few things to the binder and set everything up in ways that should be useful to authors working toward the LaTeX typesetting system. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.
You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File ▸ Save As Template….
The rest of this guide will go over the numerous convenience features that have been added to this project.
Figures
To ease typing extensive syntax and managing your images by hand, or to simply grant yourself a nicer looking working document, you can make use of Scrivener’s native inline &amp; linked image handling facilities. Graphics that you place into the editor will be exported as files and syntax will be inserted where the image was placed. For more formal figures there are two approaches you can take (you needn't commit to either exclusively):
	◆	In your text: use the "Figure" paragraph style to have the graphic enclosed in a \begin{figure} \centering ... \end{figure} environment. You can optionally insert a caption below the image (still within the "Figure" paragraph style, so as to keep it within the environment), using the "Caption" character style. Follow the caption with a "Label" styled phrase that is a valid LaTeX style bookmark label, to give this figure a cross-reference you can refer to elsewhere. With an eye on the Format Bar, click into the three different elements below; image, caption and label, to see which styles are applied to them:
#
This is the caption. latexLogo
The example provided above would generate the following LaTeX syntax when compiled:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=175pt,height=73pt]{800px-LaTeX_logo.png}
\caption{This is the caption.} 
\label{latexLogo}
\end{figure}
	◆	As a binder item: if you prefer keeping figures in separate chunks in the binder, to facilitate searching and organisation, you can use the "Figure" Section Type setting, placing the graphic in the main editor (un-styled) and supplying the caption as custom metadata in the Inspector. (A document template has been supplied for your convenience, and with an Example Figure item in the “Research” folder for your reference.) When using this technique figure labelling will be handled automatically for you, and captioning will be done in the inspector sidebar. To cross-reference to the figure in the text, refer to the following section on cross-referencing.
Figure Customization
To modify how styled text and embedded images are converted to LaTeX code, visit the Markup and Styles compile format panes, when editing this project's "LaTeX (Memoir Book)" format. The Markup pane itself sets how graphics print themselves, which is the \includegraphics line alone. The stylesheet settings for Figure, Caption and Label determine how the additional syntax is added around that.
To modify how images are converted to LaTeX when including them as binder items, visit the Section Layouts compile format pane and adjust the "Figure w/ Caption" layout's Prefix and Suffix tabs. As with styled text, the Markup pane is what is used to insert the graphic itself between the prefix and suffix.
Equations
A few helpful packages for equation typesetting can be enabled with the Equation Packages module, in the front matter folder. As with figures, equations can be added either to your binder as discrete items using dedicated Section Types, or into the text itself using Styles.
In your text
Use the "Equation" paragraph style to enclose the selected text within a \begin{figure} ... \end{figure} environment. Use the Label character style to supply a target label to the equation, if it should be numbered and be capable of being cross-referenced. Below is an example equation and label; note how the label character style is placed within the equation paragraph itself:
P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}&gt;4\right) eq:custom-label
The example provided above would generate the following LaTeX syntax when compiled:
\begin{equation}
P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}&gt;4\right) \label{eq:custom-label}
\end{equation}
As a binder item
For those that prefer to keep major elements as separate binder items, this project has two document templates designed to faciliate the organisation of equations: "Equation" and "Unnumbered Equation". If you will require cross-referencing to refer to your equations, the first option is what you want. Numbered equations will be automatically labelled for you, with that label used by internal document links pointing to it, elsewhere in the Draft. Consequently, you should not supply your own \label{...} code (or use the style) with the equation text itself. Additionally you should not use the Equation style itself, within an Equation document.
Inline equations, embedded in paragraph text, are easily formatted using raw LaTeX, but if you wish to keep your source material clean of syntax, a character style has been provided with this project. Simply paint the equation with the style, and it will add the markers for you.
Tables
Scrivener cannot convert rich text tables into LaTeX code for you. You will need to provide the proper syntax yourself, however you can focus on the tabular data itself, leaving the boilerplate text to Scrivener by making use of the “Table” Section Type when applied to individual binder items. As with binder figures, you can supply a caption as metadata. A document template has been provided as an example starting point. Working this way means you can make global adjustments to table appearance more easily, by editing the “Table w/ Caption” section layout, in the compile format settings.
Itemised and Enumerated Lists
As with tables, Scrivener cannot convert its native listing environments to LaTeX. If you would prefer the convenience of these features, for simple lists you could make use of the “Itemized List” and “Enumerated List” styles, included in this template. You will note that simple hanging indent paragraph style will be used in the editor (along with a shaded background to indicate the type of list). When compiled with the provided format, these styles will be enclosed in the proper listing environment, and will prefix each line with the \item code.
Given that basic capability, you could embellish the standard output the compiler produces with your own LaTeX code inside the styled range, and thus produce nested lists.
Creating Your Own Environments
This template includes a variety of common environments already set up for you, but it is quite likely that you will need to create your own. There are two different approaches, both demonstrated in this template:
Using Section Types
Examples of this approach include the figure, table and equation setups. These are comprised of the following ingredients:
	◆	A “Section Type” that can be used to flag items in your binder as needing to be associated with a particular environment. If you look at the Table document template, you will see that in the Metadata inspector pane, it has been assigned to the “Table” section type.
	◆	A “Section Layout” in the compile format settings is what does the heavy lifting. Edit the Format for this project by going to File ▸ Compile…, right-click on the project template's Format in the left sidebar to edit it, and in the “Section Layouts” pane, examine the “Table w/ Captions” layout. The prefix and suffix tabs for this layout are where the actual LaTeX code will be inserted around the text you type in the editor.
Using Styles
When environments are more likely to be found within a longer chunk of text, and would not be so useful broken out into their own sections, styles can also be used to insert a prefix and suffix around the text you type. The “Block Quote” or even “Emphasis” styles serve as examples of how this can be done. Visit the “Styles” pane in the compile format settings to examine how prefixes and suffixes are used with them.
Cross-References
Whenever you create a document link to another document within the compiled output, Scrivener will use an internally generated bookmark label to create an \autoref{...} link to that section. This works for the following Section Types automatically:
	◆	Part
	◆	Chapter
	◆	Section
	◆	Subsection
	◆	Subsubsection
	◆	Figure
	◆	Table
	◆	Equation
LaTeX will of course handle the rest of the job, in terms of numbering and correctly labelling the links. To adjust the behaviour of the code produced by Scrivener, modify the link prefix and suffix settings in the Markup compile format pane.
Typographic Punctuation
If you prefer to use LaTeX style punctuation yourself while writing, then Scrivener will not get in your way in doing so. However if you prefer to use its automatic typographic punctuation features (smart quotes, dashes and ellipses), the compile format has been configured to convert these forms of character punctuation to old style safe ASCII LaTeX methods. If you would rather work in a modern UTF-8 environment where typographic punctuation is acceptable, you could remove or disable the conversions from the Replacements compile format pane.
Notation
If you opt to include inline annotations and comments in your output, they will be converted to marginal notes and highlights using LaTeX tools for doing so. You may also make use of Scrivener's footnote features, as they will be converted to syntax for you.
Creating an Index
To an include an index of terms, you will first need to enable the Indexing Packages front matter module, along with the Index itself in the back matter folder. To do so, visit these sections and enable the “Include in Compile” option in the inspector’s Metadata tab.
As for marking indexed terms themselves, you could of course do so by hand, but you can also make use of the Index Term and Index Key styles:
	◆	Use the “Index Term” style to mark the word or phrase, directly in the text, that you wish to add to the index. When compiled, a key based on the selected text will be generated for you.
	◆	Use the “Index Key” style if the phrase itself doesn’t appear in the text, or if you want direct control over the indexing key itself.
</Text>
            <Comments>Given a quirk in how styles work with the text engine, you will need to select the image to see the "Figure" style, rather than merely placing the cursor to the left or right of it.</Comments>

            <Title>Hearing Protection </Title>
            <Text>Over the years, many marine engineers have suffered permanent hearing loss due to hours of exposure to the high noise levels in the engine room. You can prevent the loss of your own hearing by using proper hearing protection such as earplugs and earmuffs religiously whenever you are exposed to loud noises.

Your ear is a delicate instrument which contains thousands of fine hair cells called cilia to detect sounds. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can injure or break these cells or even tear off groups of these cells. Since the hair cells don’t ever repair themselves, when enough of them are damaged, a hearing loss results.

Short, intense, sounds such as an explosion can cause immediate and permanent hearing loss, but most hearing loss occurs gradually due to prolonged exposure to high noise levels. Most of the time this loss is so gradual that you are not even aware that it is occurring. Hearing loss is progressive and will continue to get worse as you continue to expose yourself to a noisy environment, but if you can avoid further exposure, the hearing loss won’t get any worse.

Permanent hearing loss is not the only hazard associated with noisy environments. Tinnitus is a condition where a ringing or roaring sound is heard continuously in one or both ears. Tinnitus occurs when the hair cells are damaged in such a way that they produce sound signals to the brain even in the absence of actual stimulation. This noise is sometimes described as like having a cricket permanently stuck in your ear, and is very annoying.

Sound intensity is measured in units of *decibels* (dB). The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale in which 0 dB indicates the quietest sound that can be heard by a normal person. A quiet library is about 20 dB. A normal conversation occurs at a sound level of about 60 dB. A lawnmower produces about 85 dB, and at this level you should be wearing hearing protection. Sandblasting or a rock concert has a sound intensity of about 115 dB. At this level hearing damage can occur after only about 15 minutes of unprotected exposure.

According to OSHA regulations, when the 8 hour average noise exposure is above 85 dB, employers are required to institute a noise monitoring program, provide adequate hearing protectors, and ensure employees wear them. Continual, unprotected exposure to noises louder than 85 decibels for 8 hours or more can be dangerous, and may result in hearing loss.

You can easily tell if you should be wearing hearing protection. If you find yourself in a situation where it is too noisy to carry on a conversation at arms length, or if you notice that your ears ring or feel plugged for a time after leaving a noisy environment, you can be sure that you should have been wearing your hearing protection.</Text>

            <Title>Other hazards</Title>
            <Text>Other hazards:  Enclosed spaces can present physical risks due to obstructions, sharp edges; heat exhaustion due to high temperatures and lack of ventilation, and biological dangers from poor sanitation and stagnant water. Additionally, high noise levels and vibrations in enclosed spaces can lead to hearing loss and discomfort.  Lastly, confined or isolated conditions in enclosed spaces can cause psychological stress, anxiety, and discomfort, impacting mental well-being.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and other work accessories designed to create a barrier against workplace hazards. It provides an important link in the chain of workplace safety, but PPE alone is not a substitute for safe engineering design, proper training, good work practices, safety awareness, or hazard reduction. All these elements together are required to minimize the danger of workplace hazards and maximize the safety and health of workers.
Using personal protective equipment requires hazard awareness and training on the part of the user. You must be trained to know when personal protective equipment is necessary, what type is necessary, how it is to be worn, and what its limitations are, as well as know its proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal. In addition, you must be aware that the equipment does not eliminate the hazard. If the equipment fails, you can be injured. To reduce the possibility of failure, equipment must be properly fitted, and maintained in a clean and serviceable condition.
To protect yourself, you must be wearing the proper personal protective when it is needed and recognize its limitations. The equipment must not be altered or removed even though you may find it uncomfortable. In some cases however, the equipment may be uncomfortable because it does not fit properly.
In this chapter we will discuss some of the personal protective equipment normally found and used aboard ship.</Text>

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Aboard ship and in other workplaces you will inevitably be exposed to safety hazards due to the nature of the work environment. These hazards may have severe consequences, including injuries, disruptions in operations, damage to equipment, financial loss, environmental damage, and loss of life. 
Identifying, addressing and avoiding hazards is crucial to maintaining a safe working environment, protecting yourself and others. 
In this section we describe some common hazards which you should be aware of.</Text>

            <Title>Foot Protection</Title>
            <Text>Your feet are vulnerable to many potential hazards aboard ship. For example, slips and falls due to wet and slippery decks; heavy objects falling on or rolling over your foot because of the ship’s motion or accident; punctures caused by stepping on sharp objects; and potential electrical shock when your body is grounded through the soles of your shoes. In other industries, there are other hazards to consider, chemical exposure, high temperatures, molten metal splashes, static electricity, to name a few. Proper selection of footwear can minimize the danger of these hazards.

OSHA has established regulations for safety shoe design, including impact and compression strength requirements, and they have mandated footwear requirements for many industries. For example, safety shoes or boots with impact protection are required to be worn in work areas where carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection are required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual materials handling cars) or other activities in which materials or equipment could potentially roll over an employee’s feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection are required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a foot injury. Although there are no specific OSHA requirements for safety footwear for marine engineers, it is nonetheless sensible to select and wear safety shoes based on the hazards found in the engine room.</Text>

            <Title>Eye Protection for Welding</Title>
            <Text>Always wear a welding helmet when arc welding. Your eyes, face, and neck need protection against the burning rays of the arc, and from the splatter of molten metal and slag. To protect your eyesight, make sure the welding helmet has a colored lens with at least a No. 10 shade when welding with 200 amperes or less. And never strike a welding arc before your helmet is in place. Never look at an arc from any distance with your naked eyes while someone else is welding.
Never chip slag when your eyes (or those of others nearby) are not protected by goggles, an eye shield, or the clear lens of a welding helmet. If fragments of hot slag were to hit the eye, medical attention would be required for their removal, and blindness could result. The risk of permanent eye injury is so great that you should never chip slag from a weld without protecting your eyes.</Text>

            <Text>Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and other work accessories designed to create a barrier against workplace hazards. It provides an important link in the chain of workplace safety, but PPE alone is not a substitute for safe engineering design, proper training, good work practices, safety awareness, or hazard reduction. All these elements together are required to minimize the danger of workplace hazards and maximize the safety and health of workers.   
Using personal protective equipment requires hazard awareness and training on the part of the user. You must be trained to know when personal protective equipment is necessary, what type is necessary, how it is to be worn, and what its limitations are, as well as know its proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal. In addition, you must be aware that the equipment does not eliminate the hazard. If the equipment fails, you can be injured. To reduce the possibility of failure, equipment must be properly fitted, and maintained in a clean and serviceable condition. 
To protect yourself, you must be wearing the proper personal protective when it is needed and recognize its limitations. The equipment must not be altered or removed even though you may find it uncomfortable. In some cases however, the equipment may be uncomfortable because it does not fit properly. 
In this chapter we will discuss some of the personal protective equipment normally found and used aboard ship.

            <Title>Electrical Properties</Title>
            <Text>Voltage, or electric potential difference, is a fundamental concept in electricity.  Voltage  is measured in units of volts (V), and symbolized as V.  Voltage can be seen as the &lt;q&gt;push&lt;/q&gt; or&lt;q&gt;force&lt;/q&gt; that propels electric charges within a circuit. When voltage is applied to a circuit, it creates an electric field that influences the movement of charged particles, resulting in the establishment of an electric current. In simpler terms, voltage serves as the driving force behind the flow of electric charges in an electrical system.
Voltage can be produced through several methods, including chemical reactions (such as in batteries) and the photovoltaic effect (as in solar cells). However, the most important method of is electromagnetic induction.  Electromagnetic induction is the process where a changing magnetic field induces (creates) an electric voltage in a nearby conductor.   This phenomenon is the basis for generating electricity in devices like generators and transformers.  Electrical generators will be described in more detail in &lt;xref provisional="generators"/&gt;
Current refers to the flow of electric charge in an electrical circuit. It is the rate at which electric charges, typically electrons, move through a conductor. Current is measured in amperes (A) and is represented by the symbol I. It can be thought of as the quantity of charge passing through a point in a circuit per unit of time. The flow of current occurs when there is a potential difference (voltage) applied across a conductor, providing the driving force for the movement of electric charges.
Resistance is a property of a material or component in an electrical circuit that opposes the flow of electric current. It is measured in ohms (Ω) and is denoted by the symbol R. Resistance determines the extent to which a material or device hinders the flow of electrical charge. When a voltage is applied across a conductor, the resistance restricts the flow of current, resulting in a decrease in the magnitude of the current. Materials with high resistance impede the flow of electricity more than materials with low resistance. The resistance of a component depends on factors such as its length, cross-sectional area, and the material it is made of.
Ohm’s law describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. According to Ohm's Law, the current flowing through a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage across it and inversely proportional to the resistance of the circuit. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as &lt;me&gt;I = V/R&lt;/me&gt;  where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
I is the the current in amperes
V is the voltage in volts, and 
R is the resistance in ohms (Ω). 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
In other words, an increase in voltage leads to a corresponding increase in current if the resistance remains constant, while an increase in resistance results in a decrease in current for a given voltage.</Text>

            <Title>Arc Flash and Arc Blast</Title>
            <Text>Arc flash refers to the release of intense heat, light, and energy that occurs during an electrical fault or short circuit. It is characterized by a sudden and violent discharge of electrical energy through the air. The arc flash generates extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit (19,400 degrees Celsius). The intense heat emitted during an arc flash can cause severe burns to anyone in its vicinity. Additionally, the arc flash produces a bright flash of light, which can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment.
Arc blast, on the other hand, refers to the high-pressure shockwave produced by the rapid expansion of air during an arc flash. The rapid expansion of these vapors creates a blast wave that can cause significant physical damage. Arc blasts can result in powerful pressure waves, similar to those generated by an explosion, which can cause injuries, such as concussions, fractures, hearing loss, and even fatalities. The arc blast can propel debris, molten metal, and hot gases, further exacerbating the risk to individuals in the vicinity.</Text>

            <Title>Sensible Heat and Latent Heat</Title>
            <Text>The terms &lt;em&gt;sensible heat&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;latent heat&lt;/em&gt; are often used to indicate the effect that the flow of heat has on a substance. The flow of heat from one substance to another is normally reflected in a temperature change in each substance-the hotter substance becomes cooler; the cooler substance becomes hotter. However, the flow of heat is not reflected in a temperature change in a substance that is in the process of changing from one physical state (solid, liquid, or gas) to another. When the flow of heat is reflected in a temperature change, we say that sensible heat has been added to or removed from the substance. When the flow of heat is not reflected in a temperature change but is reflected in the changing physical state of a substance, we say that latent heat has been added or removed. 
Does anything bother you in this last paragraph? It should. Here we are, talking about adding and removing heat. And, furthermore, we are talking about sensible heat and latent heat as though we had two different kinds of heat to consider. As noted before, this is common (if inaccurate) engineering language. So keep the following points clear in your mind: (1) heat is the flow of thermal energy; (2) when we talk about adding and removing heat, we mean that we are providing temperature differentials so that thermal energy can flow from one substance to another; and (3) when we talk about sensible heat and latent heat, we are talking about two different kinds of effects that can be produced by heat, but not about two different kinds of heat. 
The three basic physical states of all matter are &lt;em&gt;solid,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;liquid,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gas&lt;/em&gt; (or vapor). The physical state of a substance is closely related to the distance between molecules. The molecules are closest together in solids, farther apart in liquids, and farthest apart in gases. When the flow of heat to a substance is not reflected in a temperature change, we know that the energy is being used to increase the distance between the molecules of the substance and thus to change it from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. Such a change is known as a &lt;em&gt;phase change&lt;/em&gt;. You might say that latent heat is the energy price that must be paid for a change of state from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. The energy is not lost; rather, it is stored in the substance as internal energy. The energy price is &lt;q&gt;repaid,&lt;/q&gt; so to speak, when the substance changes back from gas to liquid or from liquid to solid. 
&lt;figure xml:id="LatentHeat_png"&gt; &lt;caption&gt;Phase Changes&lt;/caption&gt; &lt;image source="pics/thermo/LatentHeat.png" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;xref ref="LatentHeat_png"/&gt; shows the relationship between sensible heat and latent heat for one substance, water, at atmospheric pressure. The same kind of chart could be drawn up for other substances; however, different amounts of thermal energy would of course be required for each change of temperature and for each change of physical state. 
If we start with 1 pound of ice at 0 °F, we must add 16 BTU in order to raise the temperature of the ice to 32 °F. We call this adding sensible heat. To change the pound of ice at 32 °F to a pound of water at 32 °F, we must add 144 BTU (the &lt;em&gt;latent heat of fusion&lt;/em&gt;). There will be no change in temperature while the ice is melting. After all the ice has melted, however, the temperature of the water will be raised as additional heat is supplied. If we add 180 BTU that is, 1 BTU for each degree of temperature between 32 °F and 212 °F the temperature of the water will be raised to the boiling point. To change the pound of water at 212 °F, to a pound of steam at 212 °F, we must add 970 BTU (the &lt;em&gt;latent heat of vaporization&lt;/em&gt;). After all the water has been converted to steam, the addition of more heat will cause an increase in the temperature of the steam. If we add approximately 42 BTU to the pound of steam which is at 212 °F, we can superheat it to 300 °F. 
The same relationships apply when heat is being removed. The removal of 42 BTU from the pound of steam which is at 300 °F will cause the temperature to drop to 212 °F. As the pound of steam at 212 °F changes to a pound of water at 212 °F, 970 BTU are given off. When a substance is changing from a gas or vapor to a liquid, we usually use the term &lt;em&gt;latent heat of condensation&lt;/em&gt; for the heat that is given off. Notice, however, that the latent heat of condensation is exactly the same as the latent heat of vaporization. Only the terms differ to indicate whether a substance is being changed into a liquid or into a gas. The removal of another 180 BTU of sensible heat will lower the temperature of the pound of water from 212 °F to 32 °F. As the pound of water at 32 °F changes to a pound of ice at 32 °F 144 BTU are given off without any accompanying change of temperature. Further removal of heat causes the temperature of the ice to decrease.

            <Text>Chemicals that are improperly stored or incompatible substances stored in close proximity can react with one another, causing fires, explosions, or the release of toxic gases. Inadequate storage practices may also result in spills, leaks, or contamination, endangering both employees and the environment. 
It is essential to follow proper storage procedures, including segregating incompatible chemicals, labeling containers correctly, ensuring proper ventilation and temperature control, and implementing appropriate containment measures such as spill kits and secondary containment systems.  The MSDS will contain instructions regarding proper storage.
In particular, aboard ship chemical containers must always be secured so that they don’t break free and cause accidents during heavy weather.   </Text>

            <Text>An electrical circuit is a complete loop or path that allows for the regulated flow of electric current to power devices and carry out different tasks. It consists of different elements like voltage sources, switches, and electrical loads that are interconnected through wires. Electrical loads refer to devices that consume electrical energy and convert it into another form like mechanical work, light, or heat.   Motors, light bulbs and heating elements are some common examples of electrical loads.  
Series Circuit: In a series circuit, the components are connected in a single path such that the same current flows through each component. The components are connected end-to-end, creating a sequential circuit. In a series circuit, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, and the total voltage across the circuit is divided among the components. If one component fails or is disconnected, the entire circuit is broken, and the flow of current stops.

Parallel Circuit: In a parallel circuit, the components are connected in multiple paths, allowing the current to divide and flow through different branches simultaneously. Each component in a parallel circuit has the same voltage across it. The total current in the circuit is divided among the branches based on the resistance of each branch. If one component fails or is disconnected in a parallel circuit, the current can still flow through the remaining branches.

In summary, a series circuit has components connected in a single path with the same current flowing through each component, while a parallel circuit has components connected in multiple paths, allowing current to divide among the branches.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Let’s consider first the two stored forms of mechanical energy. 
Mechanical &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; energy exists because of the relative positions of two or more objects. For example, a rock resting on the edge of a cliff in such a position that it will fall freely if pushed has mechanical potential energy. Water at the top of a dam has mechanical potential energy. A sled that is being held at the top of an icy hill has mechanical potential energy. 
Mechanical &lt;em&gt;kinetic&lt;/em&gt; energy exists because of the relative velocities of two or more objects. If you push that rock, open the gate of the dam, or let go of the sled, something will move. The rock will fall; the water will flow; the sled will slide down the hill. In each case the mechanical potential energy will be changed to mechanical kinetic energy. Another way of saying this is &lt;q&gt;energy of position will be changed to energy of motion.&lt;/q&gt;
In these examples, you will notice that an external source of energy is used to get things started. Energy from some outside source is required to push the rock, open the gate of the dam, or let go of the sled. All real machines and processes require this kind of &lt;q&gt;boost&lt;/q&gt; from an energy source outside the system. For example, there is a tremendous amount of chemical energy stored in fuel oil; but this energy will not raise steam in the boiler until you have expended some energy to start the oil burning. Similarly, the energy in any one system affects other energy systems. However, it is easier to learn the basic principles of energy if we forget about all the energy systems that might be involved in or affected by each energy process. In the examples given in this chapter, therefore, we will consider only one energy process or energy system at a time, disregarding both the energy &lt;q&gt;boosts&lt;/q&gt; that may be received from outside systems and the energy transfers that may take place between the system we are considering and other systems. 
Notice that both mechanical potential energy and mechanical kinetic energy are stored forms of energy. It is easy to see why we regard mechanical potential energy as being stored, but it is not so easy to see the same thing about mechanical kinetic energy. Part of the trouble comes about because mechanical kinetic energy is often referred to as &lt;q&gt;the energy of motion,&lt;/q&gt; thus leading to the false conclusion that &lt;q&gt;energy in transition&lt;/q&gt; is somehow involved. This is not the case, however. Work is the only form of mechanical energy that can be properly considered as energy in transition. 
If you have trouble with the idea that mechanical kinetic energy is stored, rather than in transition, think of it like this. A bullet that has been fired from a gun has mechanical kinetic energy because it is in motion. The faster the bullet is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. There is no doubt in anybody’s mind that the bullet has the capacity to produce an effect, so we may safely say that it has energy. Although the bullet is in transition, the energy of the bullet is not transferred to any other object or system until the bullet strikes some object which resists its passage. When the bullet strikes against a resisting object, then, and only then, can we say that energy in transition exists, in the form of heat and work. 
In this example, we are ignoring the fact that some work is done against the resistance of the air and that some heat results from the passage of the bullet through the air. But this does not change the basic idea that kinetic energy is stored energy rather than energy in transition. The air must merely be regarded as a &lt;q&gt;resisting object&lt;/q&gt; which causes some of the stored kinetic energy of the bullet to be converted into energy in transition (heat and work) while the bullet is passing through the air. However, the major part of the stored kinetic energy does not become energy in transition until the bullet strikes an object firmer than air which resists its passage. 
In the English system of units, mechanical potential energy is measured in foot-pounds. Consider, for example, the rock at the top of the cliff. If the rock weighs 5 pounds and if the distance from the rock to the earth at the base of the cliff is 100 feet, 500 foot-pounds of mechanical potential energy exist because of the relative positions of the rock and the earth. Another way of expressing this idea is by the formula:  
&lt;me&gt;PE = mgh&lt;/me&gt;
Where: 
&lt;ul marker=""&gt;
PE = potential energy (in foot-pounds) 
mg = total weight of the object (in pounds) 
h = distance between the earth and the object (in feet) 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Mechanical kinetic energy is also measured in foot-pounds. The amount of kinetic energy present at any one time is directly related to the velocity of the moving object and to the weight of the moving object. &lt;me&gt;KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/me&gt;
Where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt; 
KE = Kinetic energy 
m = Mass of object 
v = Velocity of object relative to earth 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Mechanical potential energy can be changed into mechanical kinetic energy. If you push that 5-pound rock over the edge of the 100-foot cliff, it begins to fall, and, as it falls, it loses potential energy and gains kinetic energy. At any given moment, the total amount of mechanical energy (potential plus kinetic) stored in the system is the same - that is, 500 foot-pounds. But the proportions of potential energy and kinetic energy are changing all the time as the rock is falling. Just before the rock hits the earth, all the stored mechanical energy is kinetic energy. As the rock hits the earth, the kinetic energy is changed into energy in transition-that is, work and heat. 
Mechanical kinetic energy can likewise be changed into mechanical potential energy. For example, suppose you throw a baseball straight up in the air. The ball has kinetic energy while it is motion, but the amount of kinetic energy decreases and the amount of potential energy increases as the ball travels upward. When the ball has reached its uppermost position, just before it starts to fall back to earth, it has only potential energy. Then, as it falls back toward the earth, the potential energy is changed into kinetic energy again.

            <Title>Heat</Title>
            <Text> &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt; is a more familiar term than internal energy, but may actually be more difficult to define correctly. The important thing to remember is that heat is &lt;em&gt;thermal energy in transition&lt;/em&gt; - that is, it is thermal energy that is moving from one substance or system to another. 
An example will help to illustrate the difference between heat and internal energy. Suppose there are two equal lengths of pipe made of identical materials and containing steam at the same pressure and temperature. One pipe is well insulated; the other is not insulated at all. From everyday experience you know that more heat will flow from the uninsulated pipe than from the insulated pipe. When the two pipes are first filled with steam, the steam in one pipe contains exactly as much internal energy as the steam in the other pipe. We know this is true because the two pipes contain equal volumes of steam at the same pressure and at the same temperature. After a few minutes, the steam in the uninsulated pipe will contain much less internal energy than the steam in the insulated pipe, as we can tell by measuring the pressure and the temperature of the steam in each pipe. What has happened? Stored thermal energy - internal energy - has moved from one system to another, first from the steam to the pipe, then from the uninsulated pipe to the air. This movement or flow of thermal energy from one system to another is called heat. 
A good deal of confusion exists concerning the use of the word &lt;q&gt;heat.&lt;/q&gt; For example, you will hear people say that a hot object &lt;q&gt;contains&lt;/q&gt; a lot of heat when they really mean that it contains a lot of internal energy. Or you will hear that heat is &lt;q&gt;added to&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;removed from&lt;/q&gt; a substance. Since heat is the flow of thermal energy, it can no more be added to a substance than the flow of water could be added to a river. (You might add water, and this addition might increase the flow; but you could hardly say that you had added flow.) The only kind of thermal energy that can in any sense be added to or removed from a substance is internal energy. The distinction between heat and internal energy must be clear in your own mind before you can understand the basic principles of a steam plant. Remember, steam contains internal energy but it does not &lt;q&gt;contain heat.&lt;/q&gt; Heat exists when the internal energy flows from the steam to something else (another substance or system).

A respirator is a face piece, hood, or helmet that is designed to protect the user from a variety of harmful airborne agents. Respirators can protect you from dust and particulates in the air, hazardous vapors, oxygen deficiency, or a combination of these. Respirators are not necessary for routine operations in the engine room, but may be advisable during certain maintenance procedures such as chipping and painting. 


OSHA regulations require that respirators shall be used in the following circumstances: &lt;ul&gt;
Where exposure levels exceed the &lt;em&gt;permissible exposure limit&lt;/em&gt; (PEL), during the time period necessary to install or implement feasible engineering and work practice controls; 
In those maintenance and repair activities and during those brief or intermittent operations where exposures exceed the PEL and engineering and work practice controls are not feasible or are not required; 
In regulated areas; 
Where the employer has implemented all feasible engineering and work practice controls and such controls are not sufficient to reduce exposures to or below the PEL; and, 
In emergencies. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Before using a respirator you should be thoroughly trained in its use. Some of the areas that you should be familiar with include: respiratory hazards; respirator selection criteria, limitations, adjustment, fit, cleaning, and storage procedures, etc. The selection of a suitable respirator depends on the hazard to which you are exposed, and the correct respirator cannot be selected without a thorough understanding of the hazard.

            <Title>Eye Protection for Welding</Title>
            <Text>
Always wear a welding helmet when arc welding. Your eyes, face, and neck need protection against the burning rays of the arc, and from the splatter of molten metal and slag. To protect your eyesight, make sure the welding helmet has a coloured lens with at least a No. 10 shade when welding with 200 amperes or less. And never strike a welding arc before your helmet is in place. Never look at an arc from any distance with your naked eyes while someone else is welding. 


Never chip slag when your eyes (or those of others nearby) are not protected by goggles, an eye shield, or the clear lens of a welding helmet. If fragments of hot slag were to hit the eye, medical attention would be required for their removal, and blindness could result. The risk of permanent eye injury is so great that you should never chip slag from a weld without protecting your eyes.

            <Title>Types</Title>
            <Text>&lt;term&gt;Safety Shoes and Boots.&lt;/term&gt; Safety shoes and boots are available in many styles depending on the job requirements. Boots provide more protection than shoes from chemicals and molten metals splashes and spark hazards, but they are heavier. Some protective features that are available in both boots and shoes include: &lt;ul&gt;
Oil resistant shoes 
Chemical resistant shoes 
Heat resistant shoes 
Slip and skid resistant shoes 
Waterproof and water resistant shoes 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Steel-Reinforced Safety Shoes and Boots Similar to safety shoes, these have the toe box and insole reinforced with steel, and the instep reinforced with steel, aluminum, or plastic. These shoes will protect your feet from falling objects and puncture injuries. 
Composite-Toe Safety Shoes Composite-toe shoes have a protective cap made of non-metallic materials such as carbon fiber, Kevlar, or fiberglass. They offer lightweight protection and are ideal for environments where metal detection is required or in situations where electrical conductivity needs to be minimized.
Electrically Insulated Safety Shoes These shoes have non-conductive soles to prevent the wearer’s feet from completing an electrical circuit to ground. They can protect workers against as much as 600 volts in dry conditions. These shoes should be used in conjunction with insulated tools and precautions to reduce or eliminate the potential for providing a path for hazardous electrical energy. Non-conductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations; in such locations, electrically conductive shoes are required. 
Electrically Conductive Safety Shoes These shoes protect against the buildup of static electricity. Essentially, these shoes ground the employees wearing them. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on an employee’s body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. During training, employees must be instructed not to use foot powder or wear socks made of silk, wool, or nylon with conductive shoes. Foot powder insulates and retards the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool, and nylon produce static electricity. Conductive shoes are not general-purpose shoes and must be removed upon completion of the tasks for which they are required. Employees exposed to electrical hazards must &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; wear conductive shoes.

            <Title>Conservation of Energy</Title>
            <Text>The basic principle dealing with the transformation of energy is the &lt;em&gt;Principle of Conservation of Energy&lt;/em&gt;. This principle can be stated in several ways. Most commonly, perhaps, it is stated: &lt;q&gt;Energy can be neither destroyed nor created, but only transformed.&lt;/q&gt; Another way to state this principle is: &lt;q&gt;The total quantity of energy in the universe is always the same.&lt;/q&gt; Still another way of expressing this principle is by the equation  &lt;me&gt;\mathrm{Energy}_{in} = \mathrm{Energy}_{out}&lt;/me&gt;The &lt;q&gt;energy out&lt;/q&gt; may be quite different in form from the &lt;q&gt;energy in,&lt;/q&gt; but the total amount of energy input must always equal the total amount of energy output. 
Another principle, the &lt;em&gt;Principle of Conservation of Matter,&lt;/em&gt; states: &lt;q&gt;Matter can be neither created nor destroyed, but only transformed.&lt;/q&gt; As you probably know, the development of the atomic bomb demonstrated that matter can be converted into energy; other developments have demonstrated that energy can be converted into matter. Therefore, the Principle of the Conservation of Energy and the Principle of the Conservation of Matter are no longer considered as two parts of a single law or principle but are combined into one principle: “Matter and energy are interchangeable, and the total amount of energy and matter in the universe is constant." 
The interchangeability of matter and energy is mentioned here only to point out that the statement &lt;q&gt;energy in must equal energy out&lt;/q&gt; is not strictly true for certain situations. However, any noticeable conversion of matter into energy or energy into matter can occur only under very special conditions that we need not consider now. All the energy transformations that we will deal with can be understood quite simply if we consider only the Principle of the Conservation of Energy, that is, &lt;em&gt;Energy in must equal Energy out&lt;/em&gt;.

You should be aware of the hazardous chemicals present in your workplace, handle them safely and take precautions to minimize exposure, such as using proper ventilation systems, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), and following established protocols.  
You can learn about the potential risks associated with a chemical, as well as instructions on how to handle and respond to accidents or exposures, in the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), which is required to be available in your workplace.

For example, consider a cold metal bar which is held firmly against a piece of red-hot metal.

That is, a force acting over an area is a &lt;em&gt;pressure&lt;/em&gt;, and when you multiply a pressure by the area that it acts over, you get a force. &lt;me&gt; P = \frac{F}{A} \qquad \text{or} \qquad F = PA &lt;/me&gt;Many different units are used to describe pressure. The simplest pressure units are ones that indicate how much force is applied to an area of a certain size. These units include pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, newtons per square meter, kilopascals, bars or others depending upon the system being used. Aboard ship we most commonly use pounds per square inch (psi).

            <Title>Work</Title>
            <Text>Mechanical energy in transition is called &lt;em&gt;work.&lt;/em&gt; When an object is moved through a distance against a resisting force, we say that work has been done. The formula for calculating work is:  &lt;me&gt;W=Fd&lt;/me&gt;
Where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt; 
W = work (in foot-pounds)  
F = force (in pounds) 
d = distance moved in direction of applied force (in feet)  
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
As you can see from this formula, you need to know how much force is exerted and the distance through which the force acts before you can find how much work is done. The unit of force is the pound. When work is done against gravity, the force required to move an object is equal to the weight of the object. Why? Because weight is a measure of the force of gravity or, in other words, a measure of the force of attraction between an object and the earth. How much work will you do if you lift that 5-pound rock from the bottom of the 100-foot cliff to the top? You will do 500 foot-pounds of work-the weight of the object (5 pounds) times the distance (100 feet) that you move it against gravity. 
We also do work against forces other than the force of gravity. When you push an object across the deck, you are doing work against friction. In this case, the force you work against is not only the weight of the object; but also the force required to overcome friction and slide the object over the surface of the deck. 
Notice that mechanical potential energy, mechanical kinetic energy and work are all measured in the same unit, foot-pounds. One foot-pound of work is done when a force of 1 pound acts through a distance of 1 foot. One foot-pound of mechanical potential energy or mechanical kinetic energy is the amount of energy that is required to accomplish 1 foot-pound of work.

            <Title>Energy Relationships in the Shipboard Propulsion Cycle</Title>
            <Text>The movement of a ship through the water is the result of a number of energy transformations. Although most of these transformations have been mentioned, they have not been discussed in the proper sequence. 
The first energy transformation occurs when fuel oil is burned in the boiler furnace. By the process of combustion, the chemical energy stored in the fuel oil is transformed into thermal energy. Thermal energy flows from the burning fuel to the water in the boiler, and steam is generated. The thermal energy is now stored as internal energy in the steam, as we can tell from the increased pressure and temperature of the steam. When the steam is admitted to the turbines, the thermal energy of the steam is converted into mechanical energy, which turns the shaft and drives the ship. Two main energy transformations are involved in converting thermal energy to work in a turbine. First, the thermal energy of the steam is transformed into mechanical kinetic energy (energy of motion) as the steam flows through one or more nozzles. Second, the mechanical kinetic energy of the steam is transformed into work (mechanical energy in transition) as the steam strikes the projecting blades of the turbine and thus causes the turbine to turn. The turning of the turbine rotor causes the propeller shaft to turn also, although at a slower speed, since the turbine is connected to the propeller shaft through reduction gears. The steam exhausts from the turbine to the condenser where it gives up its latent heat of condensation to the circulating seawater. 
For the remainder of this cycle, energy is required to get the water (condensate and feedwater) back to the boiler where it will again be heated and changed into steam. The energy used for this purpose is generally the thermal energy of the auxiliary steam. In the case of turbine driven feed pumps, the conversion of thermal energy to mechanical energy occurs in the same way as it does in the case of the propulsion turbines. In the case of motor-driven pumps, the energy conversion is from thermal energy to electrical energy (in a turbogenerator) and then from electrical energy to mechanical energy (work) in the pumps. 
As you can see, putting in 1 BTU at the boiler furnace does not mean that 778 foot-pounds of mechanical energy will be available for propelling the ship through the water. Some of the energy put in at the boiler furnace is used by auxiliary machinery such as pumps and forced-draft blowers to supply the boiler with feedwater, fuel oil, and air for combustion. Distilling plants, turbo-generators, steering gears, heating systems, galley and laundry equipment, and many other units throughout the ship use energy derived directly or indirectly from the energy put in at the boiler furnace. 
In addition, there are many &lt;q&gt;energy losses&lt;/q&gt; throughout the engineering plant. As we have seen, energy cannot actually be lost. But when it is transformed into a form of energy that we cannot use, we say there has been an energy loss. Since no insulation is perfect, some thermal energy is always lost as steam travels through the piping. Friction losses occur in all machinery and piping. There is also an energy loss at the condenser as the steam exhausted from the turbines gives up heat to the circulating seawater and turns into condensate. 
Although some energy losses can be partly avoided by designing the machinery and equipment to minimize friction losses, by insulating hot surfaces, and by lubricating moving parts, some energy losses are still unavoidable. Consider, for example, the unavoidable energy loss that occurs at the condenser. To allow the flow of heat, the condenser must be at a lower temperature than the boiler since heat flow can occur only from a higher temperature area to a lower temperature area. Therefore, the energy loss at the condenser is not only unavoidable, but is also actually required for the conversion of heat to work. 
As you can see, each BTU that is put in at the boiler furnace has to be divided in many ways before all the energy can be accounted for, but the energy account will always balance. &lt;em&gt;Energy in will always equal Energy out.&lt;/em&gt;

            <Title>Fire </Title>
            <Text>Fire aboard ship is an ever-present threat that can swiftly escalate into a catastrophic disaster. With limited means of escape, a ship becomes a confined space where flames can spread rapidly, fueled by combustible materials and confined by its structure. 
The close quarters, complex layout, and intricate ventilation systems aboard ship create formidable challenges for the ship’s small firefighting team. In addition to the immediate threat to human lives, a shipboard fire poses a significant risk to the environment, as toxic smoke, potential oil spills, and the release of hazardous substances can wreak havoc on marine ecosystems. 
Effective fire prevention measures, comprehensive emergency response plans, rigorous training, and state-of-the-art firefighting equipment are crucial in mitigating this threat and ensuring the safety of everyone on board.
Fire prevention measures play a vital role in minimizing the risk of fire and maintaining a safe environment aboard ship. These measures encompass a range of proactive strategies aimed at preventing fires from starting or spreading. One fundamental aspect is implementing rigorous safety protocols and adhering to international standards, such as the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) regulations for fire safety.
Some key fire prevention measures include:
&lt;ul&gt;
 Regular Inspections and Maintenance. Conducting routine inspections of electrical systems, machinery, and fire suppression equipment is crucial. Identifying and addressing potential hazards, faulty wiring, or malfunctioning equipment can prevent fire incidents.
 Training and Education. Crew members should receive comprehensive training on fire safety, including proper handling of flammable substances, effective use of firefighting equipment, and emergency response procedures. Increasing awareness and knowledge among the crew can significantly reduce the likelihood of fire-related accidents.
 Fire Detection Systems. Installing advanced fire detection systems, such as smoke detectors, heat sensors, and flame detectors, helps in early detection of fires. These systems can trigger alarms, alerting the crew and initiating immediate response actions.
 Fire Suppression Systems. Equipping ships with reliable fire suppression systems, such as fixed CO2 or water mist systems, can effectively control and extinguish fires. These systems are designed to release the appropriate extinguishing agent in the affected area, limiting the fire's spread.
 Proper Storage and Handling. Storing flammable materials in designated areas and following strict protocols for their handling reduces the risk of accidental ignition. Implementing proper waste management procedures and ensuring the availability of suitable fire-resistant containers also contribute to fire prevention efforts.
 Structural Fire Protection. Regulations require fire-resistant materials and insulation in the ship's construction helps to contain fires and slow down their progression. Fire-resistant doors, bulkheads, and insulation compartmentalize the vessel, preventing the rapid spread of flames.
 Emergency Preparedness. Developing and regularly reviewing comprehensive emergency response plans specific to fire incidents is crucial. This includes establishing evacuation procedures, assigning roles and responsibilities to crew members, and conducting fire drills to ensure everyone knows how to respond swiftly and effectively in an emergency.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
By implementing robust fire prevention measures, ships can significantly reduce the risk of fire, enhance the crew's safety, and protect the marine environment from potential devastation.</Text>

            <Text>Electrical burns occur when electric current passes through the body, generating heat. These burns can be internal or external, depending on the path the electricity takes. Electrical burns can cause extensive tissue damage and may require specialized medical treatment. The severity of electrical burns depends on the voltage, current, duration of contact, and the body's resistance.

            <Title>Pressure Conversions</Title>
            <Text>In interpreting pressure measurements, a great deal of confusion arises because the zero point on most pressure gages represents atmospheric pressure rather than zero absolute pressure, and both pressure and head scales are used. Thus it is important to specify the kind of pressure being measured under given conditions. To clarify the numerous meanings of the word pressure, the relationship among gage pressure, atmospheric pressure, vacuum, and absolute pressure is illustrated in &lt;xref ref="PressureRelations_png"/&gt;. 
&lt;figure xml:id="PressureRelations_png"&gt; &lt;caption&gt;Pressure Relationship&lt;/caption&gt; &lt;image source="pics/thermo/PressureRelations.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
If you can remember the following facts, it is relatively easy to perform unit conversions between the various pressure scales.
Atmospheric pressure equivalents: &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;md&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \text{Atmospheric Pressure \amp= 14.7 \text{ psi} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \amp = 29.92 \textrm{ in Hg} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \amp = 760 \textrm{ mm Hg} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \amp = 34 \textrm{ ft H}_2\textrm{O} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \amp= 101.3 \textrm{ kPa} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \amp= 1.01 \textrm{ bar}&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/md&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
Absolute scales measure up from zero 
Gage scales measure up or down from atmospheric pressure 
Vacuum scales measure down from atmospheric pressure 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

            <Title>Vacuum</Title>
            <Text>A pressure below atmospheric pressure is called a vacuum. The farther below the atmospheric pressure, the greater the vacuum. Vacuum can not be made greater and greater without limit, however. At some point, the absolute pressure drops as low as possible and a perfect vacuum is achieved. A perfect vacuum is the lowest possible pressure, or the absence of all pressure. When we speak of a &lt;q&gt;high&lt;/q&gt; vacuum, we are talking about a low absolute pressure. 
When measuring a vacuum, there are three possible methods. When vacuum is measured starting with zero at perfect vacuum and increasing as pressure rises, then the greater the value, the smaller the vacuum. This is known as the absolute pressure scale. We can also measure pressure on a scale starting at zero at atmospheric pressure, and indicating negative values when the pressure is below atmospheric (vacuum) and positive values when the pressure is above atmospheric. This is the behavior of a standard pressure gage. And finally, we can measure vacuum on a scale starting with zero at atmospheric pressure and increasing as the vacuum increases. Most vacuum gages operate this way. On this scale no vacuum would be indicated by 0 psig, and a perfect vacuum would be indicated by approximately 14.7 psi vacuum. 
The most common scale used on vacuum gages aboard ship display vacuum in inches of mercury, with the vacuum gage scale marked from 0 to 30 inches of mercury. When this gage reads zero, the pressure in the space is the same as atmospheric pressure or, in other words, there is no vacuum. A vacuum gage reading of 29.92 inches of mercury would indicate a perfect (or nearly perfect) vacuum. In actual practice, it is impossible to obtain a perfect vacuum even under laboratory conditions.

            <Title>IMO Guidelines</Title>
            <Text>The IMO has developed guidelines for rest requirements to address the issue of fatigue among seafarers. These guidelines are outlined in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention). 
The STCW Convention sets out minimum hours of rest for seafarers. The standard requires that seafarers receive a minimum of 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period and a minimum of 77 hours of rest in any 7-day period. The hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, with one period being at least 6 hours in length.
In situations where the safety of the ship, crew, or passengers is compromised, and in cases of emergencies or drills, the rest period may be temporarily shortened or interrupted. However, the seafarers should be provided with compensatory rest as soon as possible.

            <Title>Convection</Title>
            <Text>At the molecular or sub-molecular level, heat transfer takes place through both the processes of conduction and radiation. If we use the term &lt;q&gt;heat transfer&lt;/q&gt; in a somewhat different way, we may also include convection as a mode of heat transfer. However, it is important to understand the difference between convection and the basic heat transfer processes of conduction and radiation. 
If we put a hot brick into a wheelbarrow and wheel it across the street, we have in one sense &lt;q&gt;transferred&lt;/q&gt; heat. However, any heat transfer that takes place between the brick and its surroundings while we are wheeling it across the street will be by conduction and by radiation. Therefore, it would really be more accurate to say that we have &lt;q&gt;transported&lt;/q&gt; the brick and all its contained thermal energy from one side of the street to the other. 
Convection occurs only in fluids – liquids, gases, and vapors – not in solids, such as the brick we have just transported in the wheelbarrow. Convection is the transportation or movement of some portions of a fluid within the total mass of the fluid. As this movement occurs, the moving portions of the fluid transfer their contained thermal energy from one part of the fluid to another. The effect of convection is thus to mix the various portions of the fluid; the part that was at the bottom of the container may move to the top, or the part that was at one side may move to the other side. As this mixing takes place, heat transfer occurs from one part of the fluid to another and between the fluid and its surroundings. But this heat transfer, like any other heat transfer, takes place by conduction and by radiation. In other words, convection transports portions of the fluid; conduction and radiation transfer the thermal energy. 
Convection serves a vital purpose in bringing the different parts of the fluid into close contact so that heat transfer can occur. Without convection, there can be little heat transfer from or within fluids. Most fluids are poor conductors of heat when they are not in motion. 
What causes this transportation of a mass of fluid? In the case of &lt;em&gt;natural convection&lt;/em&gt;, the movement is caused by differences in the density of different parts of the fluid. The differences in density are usually caused by unequal temperatures within the mass of fluid. For example, as the air over a hot radiator is heated, it becomes less dense and therefore begins to rise. Cooler, heavier air is drawn in to replace the heated air, and convection currents are thus setup. Another example of natural convection is the circulation of water in a natural circulation boiler. As the water in the generating tubes is heated, it expands and becomes much lighter (less dense) than the cooler water in the downcomers. Therefore the hotter and lighter water rises, while the cooler and heavier water flows downward. The resulting circulation of water in the boiler is thus clearly an example of convection currents established by differences in temperature (and therefore differences in density) in various parts of the fluid. 
In the case of &lt;em&gt;forced convection&lt;/em&gt;, some mechanical device such as a pump or a fan produces the movement of the fluid. When the main feed pump moves feedwater toward the boiler, the water is transported by forced convection. The flow of combustion gases through a boiler is partly by natural convection and partly by forced convection. Natural convection occurs because the gases of combustion are hotter and lighter than air, so they tend to rise and go up the stack. Forced convection is also involved in this process, however, because the forced draft blowers supply an air pressure which increases the rate at which the combustion gases travel across the tubes and up the stack. When you stir a cup of hot coffee, you are forcing convection and thus increasing the rate of heat transfer. Natural convection currents would be set up in the coffee if you did not stir it, because differences in density would occur as some portions of the coffee cooled before others. If you want to cool the coffee rapidly, use forced convection (stirring). If you do not want it to cool so rapidly, wait for natural convection to do the job. 
In summary, then, we use the term convection to describe the transportation, or loosely, the &lt;q&gt;heat transfer&lt;/q&gt; of a mass of fluid and its contained thermal energy. However, the processes by which any substance gains or loses thermal energy are most accurately described in terms of conduction and radiation.

            <Text>In the most severe cases, electric shocks can lead to electrocution, resulting in death. High-voltage shocks can cause cardiac arrest, severe internal injuries, and other life-threatening conditions. Contact with overhead power lines, unauthorized access to electrical panels or equipment, and improper handling of live wires are some situations that can lead to fatal accidents.</Text>

            <Title>introduction</Title>
            <Text>All substances are composed of molecules. The energy associated with molecules is called thermal energy. Thermal energy, like mechanical energy, exists in two stored forms and in one transitional form. The two stored forms of thermal energy are called internal potential energy, and internal kinetic energy. Thermal energy in transition is called &lt;em&gt;heat.&lt;/em&gt;Although molecules are too small to be seen, they behave in some ways pretty much like the larger objects we considered in the discussion of mechanical energy. Molecules have energy of position (internal potential energy) because of the forces which attract molecules to each other. In this way, they are somewhat like the rock and the earth we considered before. Molecules have energy of motion (internal kinetic energy) because they are constantly in motion. Thus, the two stored forms of thermal energy-internal potential energy and internal kinetic energy-are in some ways similar to mechanical potential energy and mechanical kinetic energy, except that everything is on a smaller scale.

Power is transmitted through flexible cable runs, as opposed to rigid line shafts. Furthermore, instead of relying on a single large main engine, multiple smaller engines can be used, allowing for placement in smaller spaces and more convenient locations.	</Text>

            <Text>For safe entry into a confined space, everyone involved should be properly trained on confined space entry and rescue techniques and strictly comply with all regulations and guidelines governing confined space entry. 
Begin by conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify potential hazards and establish necessary control measures. Inspect the equipment used for entry to guarantee its reliability. 
Ensure proper ventilation is in place, to maintain fresh air and remove hazardous substances. Test the atmosphere using gas detection equipment before entering to verify safe conditions. Wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protection and fall protection gear. 
Maintain proper lighting to ensure visibility within the confined space. Establish effective communication systems between individuals inside and outside the space. Designate a standby person outside the space, equipped with rescue training, to provide immediate assistance if required.

            <Title>Transforming Heat to Work</Title>
            <Text>The energy transformation of primary interest in the shipboard steam plant is the transformation from heat to work. To see how this transformation occurs, we need to consider the pressure, temperature, and volume relationships which hold true for gases. These relationships may be summarized as follows:  
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; When the temperature is held constant, increasing the pressure on a gas causes a proportional decrease in volume. Decreasing the pressure causes a proportional increase in volume.  &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; When the pressure is held constant, increasing the temperature of a gas causes a proportional increase in volume. Decreasing the temperature causes a proportional decrease in volume.  &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; When the volume is held constant, increasing the temperature of a gas causes a proportional increase in pressure. Decreasing the temperature causes a proportional decrease in pressure.  &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Suppose we have a boiler in which steam has just begun to form. With the steam stop valves still closed, the volume of the steam remains constant while the temperature and the pressure are both increasing. When operating pressure is reached and the steam stop valves are opened, the high pressure of the steam causes the steam to flow to the turbines. The pressure of the steam thus provides the potential for doing work; the actual conversion of heat to work is done in the steam turbines. The change in the internal energy (as indicated by changes in pressure and temperature) of the steam between the boiler and the condenser is an indication of the amount of heat that has been converted to work in the turbines. 
Since heat is measured in BTU and work is measured in foot-pounds, how can we compare the amount of energy put in as heat with the amount of energy put out as work? At first glance, asking how much heat equals how much work might seem like asking how many lima beans equals playing baseball. However, the problem is not that difficult, since both heat and work are forms of energy. The formula for converting heat to work is  &lt;me&gt;1 \text{ BTU} = 778 \text{ ft-lb}&lt;/me&gt; or, in other words, the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water 1 °F is the same as the amount of energy required to lift a 1-pound weight 778 feet against the force of gravity.

            <Text>Mechanical hazards are a physical hazards associated with machines and other movable objects that may cause harm to a person.
Injuries caused by mechanical hazards include friction or abrasion, lacerations, cutting, severing, pinching, crushing, or entanglement of body parts. Additionally, non-mechanical hazards such as chips, splashes, and sparks can injure you or others in the area.
Mechanical hazards can be managed by adopting safe work procedures and the application of appropriate safeguards. As such, you should always wear appropriate PPE, follow the machine’s operating instructions, and ensure that all machine safety features and guards are in place. Be aware that some machines may start automatically at any time, so take appropriate precautions including de-energizing and locking out machinery before working on it.</Text>

            <Title>Absolute Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Pressure measured on a scale increasing from zero at a perfect vacuum is known as absolute pressure. Absolute pressure is always higher than the corresponding gage pressure by the amount of the atmospheric pressure. For shipboard purposes, you can simply add 14.7 psi to the gage reading in psi to get the absolute pressure. For example, a gage pressure of 100 psig would be the same as an absolute pressure of 114.7 psia. 
We sometimes say psig to indicate gage pressure and other times we merely say psi. By common convention, gage pressure is always assumed when pressure is given in pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, or similar units. The &lt;q&gt;g&lt;/q&gt; (for gage) is added only when there is some possibility of confusion. Absolute pressure, on the other hand, is always expressed as pounds per square inch absolute (psia), pounds per square foot absolute (psfa), and so forth. It is always necessary to establish clearly just what kind of pressure we are talking about, unless this is very clear from the nature of the discussion.

            <Title>Personal Protective Equipment</Title>
            <Text>&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and other work accessories designed to create a barrier against workplace hazards. It provides an important link in the chain of workplace safety, but PPE alone is not a substitute for safe engineering design, proper training, good work practices, safety awareness, or hazard reduction. All these elements together are required to minimize the danger of workplace hazards and maximize the safety and health of workers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using personal protective equipment requires hazard awareness and training on the part of the user. You must be trained to know when personal protective equipment is necessary, what type is necessary, how it is to be worn, and what its limitations are, as well as know its proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal. In addition, you must be aware that the equipment does not eliminate the hazard. If the equipment fails, you can be injured. To reduce the possibility of failure, equipment must be properly fitted, and maintained in a clean and serviceable condition. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To protect yourself, you must be wearing the proper personal protective when it is needed and recognize its limitations. The equipment must not be altered or removed even though you may find it uncomfortable. In some cases however, the equipment may be uncomfortable because it does not fit properly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this chapter we will discuss some of the personal protective equipment normally found and used aboard ship. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt; 
&lt;section xml:id="headprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Head Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Head injuries are caused by falling or flying objects, or by bumping your head against a fixed object. Head protection, in the form of protective hats, must do two things – resist penetration and absorb the shock of the blow. This is accomplished by making the shell of the hat of a material hard enough to resist the blow, and by utilizing a shock-absorbing lining composed of headband and crown straps to keep the shell away from the wearer’s skull. Protective hats are also used to protect against electric shock. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt;

&lt;subsection xml:id="typesofheadprotection"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Types of Head Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Class A.&lt;/term&gt; Class A hard hats and caps are intended for general service and they provide protection against impact hazards and a limited protection against electrical shock. They are used in industries such as construction, manufacturing, mining, and shipbuilding. This is the most suitable hard hat for shipboard use. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Class B.&lt;/term&gt; Class B hard hats are utility service hats which are designed to protect the wearer’s head from impact and penetration by falling or flying objects and from high-voltage shock and burns. They are used extensively by electrical workers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure xml:id="hardhats_jpg"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Hard Hat&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="pics/ppe/hardhats.jpg" /&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Class C.&lt;/term&gt; The safety hat or cap in Class C is designed specifically for lightweight comfort and impact protection and is sometimes known as a bump cap. Class C helmets are used on occasions where there is a possibility of bumping the head against a fixed object and no danger from falling objects or electrical shock. Bump caps can be worn for protection against scalp lacerations from contact with sharp objects. However, they are not substitutes for safety caps/hats because they do not afford protection from high impact forces or penetration by falling objects. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="fit"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Fit&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Correct adjustment and fit of the your hard hat is required for maximum safety. The internal cradle of the headband and sweatband forms a suspension system which keeps the helmet away from the head and cushions against impact. The headband must be adjusted to the right size in order to provide sufficient clearance between the shell and the headband. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before using a hard hat you should inspect it for signs of damage or abuse of the helmet or any of its parts. A damaged helmet reduces the margin of safety the hat was designed to supply, and should be replaced immediately. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section xml:id="eyeprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Eye Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Every day more than 1,000 eye injuries occur in American workplaces. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that three out of five workers who suffered eye injuries were not wearing eye protective equipment at the time of the accident, and when asked why, the victims often claimed that eye protection was not normally used in their type of work, or it was not required for the type of work performed at the time of the accident. Eye protection can save your sight, but you must be wearing it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eye injuries can occur in many ways, but are primarily caused by rapidly flying objects. The BLS found that almost 70% of eye injuries were caused by flying or falling objects or sparks striking the eye. Most of these objects were smaller than a pin head, and were traveling faster than a hand-thrown object. Another 20% of eye injuries were caused by chemicals, and the remainder due to miscellaneous causes such as objects swinging into the eye, pulled into the eye or by light radiation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eye injuries can be prevented by wearing effective eye protection. To be effective, the eyewear must be of the appropriate type for the hazard encountered and properly fitted. The BLS survey found that 94% of the injuries to workers wearing eye protection were caused by objects or chemicals going around or under the protector. Goggles provide better protection than face shields or safety glasses, but the best protection is afforded when both goggles and a face shield are worn together. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="typesofeyeprotection"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Types of Eye Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The three main types of eye protection for general maintenance are safety glasses, goggles, and face shields. In addition, when welding, specialized equipment must be used to protect your eyes. Each method of eye protection has its own advantages and disadvantages. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Safety Glasses.&lt;/term&gt; Safety glasses are lightweight glasses that have shatter resistant lenses made of materials like polycarbonate or propionate plastic and often have side shields attached to the side pieces. Safety glasses are designed to stop flying objects such as chips, fragments, sand, and dirt from injuring your eyes. They also can provide laser light filtration to prevent reflections from the laser entering the eye and causing retinal burns. Safety glasses can be purchased with prescription lenses including bifocals if necessary. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The main advantage of safety glasses is that they are lightweight and relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The provide little to no protection from liquids or vapors, and some flying particles may get around the side shields. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure xml:id="goggles_jpg"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Types of Eye Protection&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="pics/ppe/goggles.jpg" /&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Goggles.&lt;/term&gt; Goggles provide more complete protection of the eye than safety glasses, since they protect against both frontal and side impact. They come in two different types, vented and non-vented. Vented goggles are used to protect your eyes from splashes and flying objects, while Non-vented Goggles additionally protect your eyes from hazardous vapors, mists, and fumes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Face Shields.&lt;/term&gt; Face shields are designed to augment other types of eye protection and are not meant to be a stand alone form of eye protection. Face shields are used to protect your entire face with goggles on under the shield to catch any liquids that might make it past the shield. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="eyeprotectionforwelding"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Eye Protection for Welding&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Always wear a welding helmet when arc welding. Your eyes, face, and neck need protection against the burning rays of the arc, and from the splatter of molten metal and slag. To protect your eyesight, make sure the welding helmet has a colored lens with at least a No. 10 shade when welding with 200 amperes or less. And never strike a welding arc before your helmet is in place. Never look at an arc from any distance with your naked eyes while someone else is welding. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Never chip slag when your eyes (or those of others nearby) are not protected by goggles, an eye shield, or the clear lens of a welding helmet. If fragments of hot slag were to hit the eye, medical attention would be required for their removal, and blindness could result. The risk of permanent eye injury is so great that you should never chip slag from a weld without protecting your eyes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section xml:id="hearingprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Hearing Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, many marine engineers have suffered permanent hearing loss due to hours of exposure to the high noise levels in the engine room. You can prevent the loss of your own hearing by using proper hearing protection such as earplugs and earmuffs religiously whenever you are exposed to loud noises. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your ear is a delicate instrument which contains thousands of fine hair cells called cilia to detect sounds. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can injure or break these cells or even tear off groups of these cells. Since the hair cells don’t ever repair themselves, when enough of them are damaged, a hearing loss results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Short, intense, sounds such as an explosion can cause immediate and permanent hearing loss, but most hearing loss occurs gradually due to prolonged exposure to high noise levels. Most of the time this loss is so gradual that you are not even aware that it is occurring. Hearing loss is progressive and will continue to get worse as you continue to expose yourself to a noisy environment, but if you can avoid further exposure, the hearing loss won’t get any worse. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Permanent hearing loss is not the only hazard associated with noisy environments. Tinnitus is a condition where a ringing or roaring sound is heard continuously in one or both ears. Tinnitus occurs when the hair cells are damaged in such a way that they produce sound signals to the brain even in the absence of actual stimulation. This noise is sometimes described as like having a cricket permanently stuck in your ear, and is very annoying. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sound intensity is measured in units of &lt;em&gt;decibels&lt;/em&gt; (dB). The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale in which 0 dB indicates the quietest sound that can be heard by a normal person. A quiet library is about 20 dB. A normal conversation occurs at a sound level of about 60 dB. A lawnmower produces about 85 dB, and at this level you should be wearing hearing protection. Sandblasting or a rock concert has a sound intensity of about 115 dB. At this level hearing damage can occur after only about 15 minutes of unprotected exposure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
According to OSHA regulations, when the 8 hour average noise exposure is above 85 dB, employers are required to institute a noise monitoring program, provide adequate hearing protectors, and ensure employees wear them. Continual, unprotected exposure to noises louder than 85 decibels for 8 hours or more can be dangerous, and may result in hearing loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can easily tell if you should be wearing hearing protection. If you find yourself in a situation where it is too noisy to carry on a conversation at arms length, or if you notice that your ears ring or feel plugged for a time after leaving a noisy environment, you can be sure that you should have been wearing your hearing protection. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="typesofhearingprotectors"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Types of Hearing Protectors&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;figure xml:id="Hearing_Protection_png"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Types of Hearing Protection&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="pics/ppe/Hearing_Protection.png" width="50%" /&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Disposable foam plugs.&lt;/term&gt; Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each person’s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Reusable, pre-molded plugs.&lt;/term&gt; Pre-molded plugs are made from silicone, plastic or rubber and are manufactured as either &lt;q&gt;one-size-fits-most&lt;/q&gt; or are available in several sizes. Be sure to choose the proper size for your ear canals. In some cases, different size plugs may be required for each ear. The advantage of pre-molded plugs are that they are inexpensive, reusable, washable, convenient to carry, and come in a variety of sizes. Nearly everyone can find a plug that will be comfortable and effective. Another advantage is that in a dirty environment like the engine room, you don’t need to handle or roll the tips. You insert this type of plug by reaching over your head with one hand to pull up on your ear. Then use your other hand to insert the plug with a gentle rocking motion until you have sealed the ear canal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Hearing Bands.&lt;/term&gt; Hearing Bands, also called canal caps or semi-insert devices often resemble earplugs on a flexible plastic or metal band. The earplug tips of a canal cap may be a formable or pre-molded material. Some have headbands that can be worn over the head, behind the neck or under the chin. The main advantage of canal caps is their convenience They are easy to put on and take off . When it’s quiet, employees can leave the band hanging around their necks, but they can quickly insert the plug tips when hazardous noise starts again. These devices are ideal for intermittent use, but they provide less protection then either plugs or muffs. Some people find the pressure from the bands uncomfortable. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;assemblage xml:id="what_is_a_decibel"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;What is a Decibel?&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first let’s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power &lt;m&gt;P_1&lt;/m&gt;, and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power &lt;m&gt;P_2&lt;/m&gt;, but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by &lt;me&gt;10 \log (P_2/P_1) \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt; where the log is to base 10. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is &lt;me&gt; 10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 2 = 3 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;. If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be &lt;me&gt;10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 10 = 10 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;B. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be &lt;me&gt; 10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 1,000,000 = 60 \text{ dB} &lt;/me&gt;. This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, &lt;m&gt;p&lt;/m&gt;. The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of &lt;m&gt;x&lt;/m&gt; is just &lt;m&gt; 2 \log x &lt;/m&gt;, this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with &lt;m&gt;p_1&lt;/m&gt; and &lt;m&gt;p_2&lt;/m&gt; is defined as: &lt;me&gt; 20 \log (p_2/ p_1) \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt; where the log is to base 10. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries. So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that &lt;m&gt;20 \log (p_2/p_1) = 86 &lt;/m&gt; dB where &lt;m&gt;p_1&lt;/m&gt; is the sound pressure of the reference level, and &lt;m&gt;p_2&lt;/m&gt; that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: &lt;m&gt;\log (p_2/p_1) = 4.3 &lt;/m&gt; dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level &lt;me&gt; = 20 \log (p / p_{ref}) = 20 \log 1 = 0 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;. So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/assemblage&gt; &lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section xml:id="respiratoryprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Respiratory Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
A respirator is a face piece, hood, or helmet that is designed to protect the user from a variety of harmful airborne agents. Respirators can protect you from dust and particulates in the air, hazardous vapors, oxygen deficiency, or a combination of these. Respirators are not necessary for routine operations in the engine room, but may be advisable during certain maintenance procedures such as chipping and painting. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OSHA regulations require that respirators shall be used in the following circumstances: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Where exposure levels exceed the &lt;em&gt;permissible exposure limit&lt;/em&gt; (PEL), during the time period necessary to install or implement feasible engineering and work practice controls; 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		In those maintenance and repair activities and during those brief or intermittent operations where exposures exceed the PEL and engineering and work practice controls are not feasible or are not required; 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		In regulated areas; 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Where the employer has implemented all feasible engineering and work practice controls and such controls are not sufficient to reduce exposures to or below the PEL; and, 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		In emergencies. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before using a respirator you should be thoroughly trained in its use. Some of the areas that you should be familiar with include: respiratory hazards; respirator selection criteria, limitations, adjustment, fit, cleaning, and storage procedures, etc. The selection of a suitable respirator depends on the hazard to which you are exposed, and the correct respirator cannot be selected without a thorough understanding of the hazard. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="typesofrespirators"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Types of Respirators&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OSHA divides respirators into two categories: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure xml:id="respirators1_jpg"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Air-purifying respirator&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="pics/ppe/respirators1.jpg" width="50%" /&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Air-purifying Respirators.&lt;/term&gt; These units have filters, cartridges, or canisters that remove contaminants from the air by passing the air through the air-purifying element before it reaches the user. Air purifying respirators are further divided into: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Particulate Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which capture particles such as dusts, paint fumes, and mists, but do not protect against gases and vapors. The filters in particulate respirators generally work better as particles accumulate on the filter. If the filter becomes so clogged that it is difficult to breathe, it should be replaced. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Gas and Vapor Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which use a chemical cartridge or canister to remove dangerous gases or vapors, but which do not protect against airborne particles. These units only protect against specific gases or vapors, and only provide protection as long as the filter’s absorbing capacity remains. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Combination Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which can be used in atmospheres that contain both hazardous gases and particles. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure xml:id="respirators2_jpg"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Atmosphere-supplying respirators&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="pics/ppe/respirators2.jpg" width="50%" /&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Atmosphere-supplying Respirators.&lt;/term&gt; These units supply clean air directly to the user from a source other than the air surrounding the user. The types of air-supplying respirators are: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Air Supplied Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which have a hose which connects to a source of clean air under pressure. These units have no time limit on the air supply, but the hose limits the range and mobility of the user and is susceptible to damage. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus&lt;/em&gt;, which have a wearable clean-air supply pack. These units have better mobility than the air-supplied respirator, but the clean air time is limited to the capacity of the tank. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Combination Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which are similar to the air-supplied respirators, but also have a small, self-contained air supply which can be used for escape if the primary supply fails. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section xml:id="armandhandprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Arm and Hand Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
The National Safety Council has found that hands are the body part most frequently injured on the job. Accidents to the hand fall into these categories: abrasions, cuts, punctures, crushes, contact with moving machinery, burns, and chemical injuries. Gloves and hand protection are available to protect you from nearly all of these hazards. However, glove selection must be based on performance characteristics of the gloves, conditions, durations of use, and hazards present. One type of glove will not work in all situations. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the engine room, particular hazards include high temperatures and moving machinery. Long sleeved shirts are advisable to protect your arms, and you should always have a pair of work gloves available to use when necessary to protect your hands when working around hot pipes. Special high temperature gloves should always be worn when changing burners, and the appropriate chemical resistant gloves should be worn when working with burner cleaning and boiler chemicals. You should also pay particular attention to avoid contact with moving parts of machinery or power tools with moving parts, and insure that safety guards are always in place. Gloves should always be inspected for damage before use. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="typesofgloves"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Types of Gloves&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is a broad selection of safety gloves available to protect your hands from workplace hazards. For example: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Disposable Gloves - protects against mild irritants and bodily fluids 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Rubber Lineman’s Gloves and sleeves - protects against shock when working on live wires 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Metal Mesh Gloves - protects against accidental cuts when using knives 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Chemical Resistant Gloves - proper selection of material can resists chemical attack 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Cleanroom Gloves - maintains cleanliness of electronic parts 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Cotton Work Gloves - improves grip and protects from heat and cold 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		General Purpose Leather Gloves - protects against cuts and moderate temperatures 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Temperature Resistant Gloves - protects from high temperatures 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Welder’s Gloves - protects from high temperatures and sparks 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section xml:id="footprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Foot Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Your feet are vulnerable to many potential hazards aboard ship. For example, slips and falls due to wet and slippery decks; heavy objects falling on or rolling over your foot because of the ship’s motion or accident; punctures caused by stepping on sharp objects; and potential electrical shock when your body is grounded through the soles of your shoes. In other industries, there are other hazards to consider, chemical exposure, high temperatures, molten metal splashes, static electricity, to name a few. Proper selection of footwear can minimize the danger of these hazards. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OSHA has established regulations for safety shoe design, including impact and compression strength requirements, and they have mandated footwear requirements for many industries. For example, safety shoes or boots with impact protection are required to be worn in work areas where carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection are required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual materials handling cars) or other activities in which materials or equipment could potentially roll over an employee’s feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection are required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a foot injury. Although there are no specific OSHA requirements for safety footwear for marine engineers, it is nonetheless sensible to select and wear safety shoes based on the hazards found in the engine room. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="typesofsafetyshoes"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Types of Safety Shoes&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Safety Shoes and Boots.&lt;/term&gt; Safety shoes and boots are available in many styles depending on the job requirements. Boots provide more protection than shoes from chemicals and molten metals splashes and spark hazards, but they are heavier. Some protective features that are available in both boots and shoes include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Oil resistant shoes 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Chemical resistant shoes 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Heat resistant shoes 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Slip and skid resistant shoes 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Waterproof and water resistant shoes 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Steel-Reinforced Safety Shoes and Boots.&lt;/term&gt; Similar to safety shoes, these have the toe box and insole reinforced with steel, and the instep reinforced with steel, aluminum, or plastic. These shoes will protect your feet from falling objects and puncture injuries. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Electrically Insulated Safety Shoes.&lt;/term&gt; These shoes have non-conductive soles to prevent the wearer’s feet from completing an electrical circuit to ground. They can protect workers against as much as 600 volts in dry conditions. These shoes should be used in conjunction with insulated tools and precautions to reduce or eliminate the potential for providing a path for hazardous electrical energy. Non-conductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations; in such locations, electrically conductive shoes are required. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Electrically Conductive Safety Shoes.&lt;/term&gt; These shoes protect against the buildup of static electricity. Essentially, these shoes ground the employees wearing them. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on an employee’s body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. During training, employees must be instructed not to use foot powder or wear socks made of silk, wool, or nylon with conductive shoes. Foot powder insulates and retards the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool, and nylon produce static electricity. Conductive shoes are not general-purpose shoes and must be removed upon completion of the tasks for which they are required. Employees exposed to electrical hazards must &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; wear conductive shoes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;

            <Title>Enthalpy</Title>
            <Text>When discussing a system involving work and heat, such as a boiler and turbine, you may hear the term &lt;em&gt;enthalpy.&lt;/em&gt; Enthalpy is a thermodynamic quantity defined as the sum of internal energy and the work done by the substance to move its surroundings out of the way as it moves or expands, known as &lt;q&gt;flow work.&lt;/q&gt; One consequence of this definition is that when heat flows into a substance at constant pressure, its enthalpy increases by the amount of heat energy added. This is why enthalpy is sometimes described as the &lt;q&gt;heat content&lt;/q&gt; of a substance. Remember that heat is energy in transition, and is never stored so no substance ever really &lt;q&gt;contains&lt;/q&gt; heat.

            <Title>Types of Hearing Protectors</Title>
            <Text>There are various types of hearing protection available to safeguard against excessive noise levels. Here are some common types:
&lt;figure xml:id="Hearing_Protection_png"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Types of Hearing Protection&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image source="pics/ppe/Hearing_Protection.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;Disposable foam plugs.&lt;/term&gt; Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each person’s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better. 
   &lt;term&gt;Reusable, pre-molded plugs.&lt;/term&gt; Pre-molded plugs are made from silicone, plastic or rubber and are manufactured as either &lt;q&gt;one-size-fits-most&lt;/q&gt; or are available in several sizes. Be sure to choose the proper size for your ear canals. In some cases, different size plugs may be required for each ear. The advantage of pre-molded plugs are that they are inexpensive, reusable, washable, convenient to carry, and come in a variety of sizes. Nearly everyone can find a plug that will be comfortable and effective. Another advantage is that in a dirty environment like the engine room, you don’t need to handle or roll the tips. You insert this type of plug by reaching over your head with one hand to pull up on your ear. Then use your other hand to insert the plug with a gentle rocking motion until you have sealed the ear canal. 
   &lt;term&gt;Hearing Bands.&lt;/term&gt; Hearing Bands, also called canal caps or semi-insert devices often resemble earplugs on a flexible plastic or metal band. The earplug tips of a canal cap may be a formable or pre-molded material. Some have headbands that can be worn over the head, behind the neck or under the chin. The main advantage of canal caps is their convenience They are easy to put on and take off . When it’s quiet, employees can leave the band hanging around their necks, but they can quickly insert the plug tips when hazardous noise starts again. These devices are ideal for intermittent use, but they provide less protection then either plugs or muffs. Some people find the pressure from the bands uncomfortable. 
&lt;assemblage xml:id="what_is_a_decibel"&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;What is a Decibel?&lt;/title&gt;
The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first let’s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power P_1, and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power P_2, but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by &lt;me&gt;10 \log (P_2/P_1) \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt; where the log is to base 10. 
If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is &lt;me&gt; 10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 2 = 3 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;. If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be &lt;me&gt;10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 10 = 10 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;B. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be &lt;me&gt; 10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 1,000,000 = 60 \text{ dB} &lt;/me&gt;. This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size. 
Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, p. The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of x is just  2 \log x , this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with p_1 and p_2 is defined as: &lt;me&gt; 20 \log (p_2/ p_1) \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt; where the log is to base 10. 
This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries. So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that 20 \log (p_2/p_1) = 86  dB where p_1 is the sound pressure of the reference level, and p_2 that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: \log (p_2/p_1) = 4.3  dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long. 
What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level &lt;me&gt; = 20 \log (p / p_{ref}) = 20 \log 1 = 0 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;. So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals. 
&lt;/assemblage&gt;

            <Text>A job hazard analysis (JHA), also known as a job safety analysis (JSA), is a systematic process used to identify and analyze potential hazards or risks associated with specific job tasks or activities. Its primary purpose is to reduce the risk of accidents by identifying potential hazards and developing appropriate controls to mitigate them.
The process typically involves breaking down a job into its individual steps  and examining each step to identify potential hazards. Hazards can include physical hazards (e.g., machinery, equipment, or environmental conditions), chemical hazards (e.g., exposure to hazardous substances), biological hazards (e.g., exposure to infectious agents), ergonomic hazards (e.g., repetitive motion or lifting heavy objects), or any other factors that could pose a risk to worker safety and health.
The key steps in conducting a job hazard analysis typically include: 
&lt;ol&gt;
Select the job or task to be analyzed.
 Break down the job into steps.
 Identify potential hazards for each step.
 Determine the risk level for each identified hazard.  Risk level multiplies severity and the likelihood of each identified hazard.
 Develop hazard controls to eliminate or minimize the hazards. This might include engineering controls (e.g., machine guarding), administrative controls (e.g., training or procedures), or personal protective equipment (PPE)
 Communicate the findings to workers and stakeholders to ensure awareness and buy-in.
Regularly review and update the job hazard analysis.
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This results of the JHA can be shared with the crew during a toolbox talk in order to raise awareness about known hazards, reinforce safe work practices, and promote a culture of safety. These talks are usually conducted before the start of the work day.
Systematically analyzing and communicating job hazards and implementing appropriate controls helps to create a safer workplace.

            <Text> &lt;em&gt;Adapted from Principles of Naval Engineering&lt;/em&gt;The process of generating steam is basically simple. You boil water and continue to add heat until the water turns into steam. But how can this steam cause a ship to move through the water? How can steam provide power for steering, ventilation, refrigeration, distillation of seawater, and all the other needs of the vessel? 
Steam does not do any of these things directly. But some of the thermal energy contained in the steam can be converted into other forms of energy to move the ship through the water and to provide power for vital shipboard services. 
In this chapter we will discuss some basic ideas of energy and some of the important energy transformations that occur in the engineering plant of a steam-driven ship. Study this chapter carefully. The information given here will not help you to light off a boiler, clean firesides, stand a watch, or wipe up oil from the floorplates; however, it will help you to understand the generation of steam, the use of steam in the shipboard engineering plant, and the relationship of the boilers to the rest of the engineering plant. Understanding the information given in this chapter will also give you a sound background for understanding some of the more complicated things that you will have to learn as you advance. 
As you study this chapter, watch out for unfamiliar definitions. Many of the words and terms used will be familiar to you, but the definitions we use may be more precise than the ones you have heard before. Be sure that you understand the exact meaning of each word and term used in connection with energy and energy transformations. </Text>

Pressures are usually measured up or down from atmospheric pressure, and an ordinary pressure gage reads zero when it is subjected to atmospheric pressure only. Pressures measured in this way is called the gage pressure. It is important to distinguish between gage pressure and the absolute pressure described in the next section.

            <Title>Principle of operation</Title>
            <Text>An electrical generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy by utilizing the principle of electromagnetic induction.   Electromagnetic induction was first discovered in the early 19th century by English scientist Michael Faraday (1791 &lt;ndash/&gt; 1867) . According to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, a changing magnetic field induces an electric voltage in a nearby conductor. If the conductor forms a closed loop, an electric current will flow through it.

A generator consists of two main components: a rotating part called the rotor and a stationary part called the stator. In a typical AC synchronous generator, the rotor carries the field windings which produce the magnetic field, and the stator carries the armature windings, where the voltage is induced. 
A direct current (DC) is passed through the rotor's field windings to create the magnetic field.   The process of supplying electrical current to the field winding is known as excitation.  Alternately, some generators use permanent magnets to supply the magnetic field, but this has the disadvantage that the field is not adjustable.  The rotor is connected to a prime mover, such as a steam turbine or a diesel engine, and as it spins it produces a rotating magnetic field.  
The stator consists of multiple windings arranged in a specific configuration. The rotating magnetic field interacts with the stator windings, inducing a voltage across them. If the stator winding are connected to a closed circuit containing a load like a motor or resistor, the induced voltage drives current through the circuit and transmits power to load. 
The induced voltage is proportional to the speed of rotation and also the strength of the magnetic field, therefore the output voltage can be adjusted by controlling the excitation current. The frequency in Hz (cycles/sec) depends on the speed of rotation and the number of magnetic poles. &lt;me&gt; f = \frac{P \;n }{120}&lt;/me&gt; where &lt;ul marker = ""&gt;
f = frequency
n= speed 
P = number of north/south pole pairs
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
The induced voltage is typically generated at a fixed frequency, such as 60 Hz in the United States.
To generate three-phase power, the stator is fitted with three windings arranged symmetrically, 120 degrees apart from each other. As the rotor rotates, the rotating magnetic field induces voltages into each stator winding in turn, generating three sine waves of voltage, equally spaced, shown in &lt;xref ref="three-phase"/&gt;.

The pilot generator is used to supply current to the exciter field, making the main generator separately excited, as opposed to self excited, where the output of the main generator itself is used to supply power to the the exciter generator. The AC output voltage of the pilot generator varies with the rotor speed, however its output current is automatically adjusted by an Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) to maintain its rated output (terminal) voltage, regardless of the load changes. 
The pilot generator consists of stator and rotor part as shown in &lt;xref ref="exciter_exploded"/&gt; and &lt;xrer ref="pilot_generator"/&gt;.  The rotor part carries sixteen permanent magnets bolted on the shaft with alternating polarities making this a Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG).  The stator part is bolted on the bearing housing of non drive-end side of the generator and carries 3-phase wye-connected armature windings.  The rotating magnets induce an AC voltage into the armature windings and three-phase rectifier attached to the stator converts the AC voltage to a DC voltage.  
The resulting DC voltage is used to create a stationary magnetic field in the exciter.  In other words, the pilot generator excites the exciter, which in turn excites the main generator.

            <Title>Impaired cognitive function</Title>
            <Text>Fatigue can significantly impair cognitive abilities, including attention, concentration, memory, and decision-making. This can lead to reduced performance and increased errors, particularly in tasks that require sustained focus or critical thinking, such as driving, operating machinery, or performing complex work.
Fatigue can slow down reaction times and impair alertness, making it more challenging to respond quickly and appropriately to stimuli or unexpected events. This can increase the risk of accidents, both in occupational settings and during activities like driving or operating heavy equipment.
Fatigue-related impairment can lead to an increased risk of accidents and injuries across various domains, including workplaces, roadways, and other high-risk environments. Fatigue-related accidents have been linked to major incidents in industries such as transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing.
Fatigue can impair an individual's ability to assess risks accurately and make sound judgments. This can result in poor decision-making, potentially leading to safety hazards or negative consequences in various aspects of life, including personal relationships and professional responsibilities.</Text>

            <Title>Force</Title>
            <Text>What is force? In simple terms, a force is a push or a pull. More precisely, a force is a  vector quantity which tends to produce an acceleration of a body in the direction of its  application. This means that if you want a stationary object to move, you must apply a force  to it to get it going. If you want to keep it moving, you need to continuously apply a force  to it to overcome friction, which is itself a force. Forces can exist without motion too –  when an object is stationary it’s usually because there are many forces acting on it which  cancel each other out, leaving no net force acting on the object. Forces always occur in  pairs. A push on an object is always accompanied by an equal and opposite force acting on the  pusher. 
In the English system of units, force is measured in pounds, tons, or long tons. In the SI  system, force is measured in newtons (N) or kilonewtons (kN). For estimation purposes, a  newton is about a quarter of a pound. 
One important force which we experience every day is weight. Weight is the force of gravity  - the attraction between an object and the earth. The weight force exerted on an object is  proportional to the mass of the object according to Newton’s second law, which states:  &lt;me&gt;W = mg&lt;/me&gt; where &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; is the weight, &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; is the mass, and &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; is the  gravitational constant. 
The constant &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; depends on where you are: on earth the constant is greater than it  is on the moon, so you weigh less on the moon than you do on earth. In outer space, the  constant is zero, making you weightless there. Be careful not to confuse weight with mass. The  mass of an object will not change when it moves to another location, but its weight may. One  reason why people often confuse weight with mass is because in the English system and on the  surface of the earth, the gravitational constant &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; is equal to 1, and so one pound of  mass has a weight of one pound of force. Move to the moon, and the pound of mass now weighs  about six tenths of a pound. On earth in the SI system, &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; is approximately equal to  9.81 \textrm{m/s}^2.

            <Title>The Generation of Steam</Title>
            <Text>When a liquid boils, it generates a vapor, that is, some or all of the liquid changes its physical state from liquid to gas (or vapor). As long as the vapor is in contact with the liquid from which it is being generated, it remains at the same temperature as the boiling liquid. In this condition, the liquid and its vapor are said to be in &lt;em&gt;equilibrium contact&lt;/em&gt; with each other. 
The temperature at which a boiling liquid and its vapor may exist in equilibrium contact depends on the pressure under which the process takes place. As the pressure increases, the boiling temperature increases. As the pressure decreases, the boiling temperature decreases. For each liquid, therefore, the boiling point is determined by the pressure. 
When a liquid is boiling and generating vapor, the liquid is called a &lt;em&gt;saturated liquid&lt;/em&gt;, and the vapor is called a &lt;em&gt;saturated vapor&lt;/em&gt;. The temperature at which a liquid boils under a given pressure is called the &lt;em&gt;saturation temperature&lt;/em&gt;, and the corresponding pressure is called the &lt;em&gt;saturation pressure&lt;/em&gt;. For each pressure there is a corresponding saturation temperature, and for each temperature there is a corresponding saturation pressure. A few saturation pressures and temperatures for water are listed below. 
Atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia at sea level and lesser at higher altitudes. Trying to cook potatoes at the top of a high mountain takes a great deal longer than it would at sea level. Why is this? As noted before, temperature and pressure are indications of internal energy. Since it is not possible to raise the temperature of the boiling water above the saturation temperature for that pressure, the amount of internal energy available for cooking the potatoes is much less at high altitudes than it is at sea level. By the same line of reasoning, you should be able to figure out why the potatoes cook faster in a pressure cooker than in an open kettle. 
A peculiar thing happens to water and steam at an absolute pressure of 3206.2 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature at 705.40 °F. At this point, which is called the &lt;em&gt;critical point,&lt;/em&gt; the vapor and the liquid are indistinguishable. No change of state occurs when the pressure is increased above this point or when heat is added. At the critical point, we can no longer refer to &lt;q&gt;water&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;steam,&lt;/q&gt; since we cannot tell the water and steam apart. Instead, the substance is merely called a &lt;q&gt;fluid&lt;/q&gt; or a &lt;q&gt;working substance.&lt;/q&gt; Boilers designed to operate at pressures and temperatures above the critical point are called &lt;em&gt;supercritical&lt;/em&gt; boilers. Supercritical boilers are not used, at present, in propulsion plants of ships; however, some boilers of this type are used in stationary steam power plants. 
If we generate steam by boiling water in an open pan at atmospheric pressure, the water and the steam which is in immediate contact with the water will remain at 212 °F until all the water has been evaporated. If we fit an absolutely tight cover to the pan, so that no steam can escape while we continue to add heat, both the pressure and the temperature inside the vessel will rise. The steam and water will both increase in temperature and pressure, and each fluid will be at the same temperature and pressure as the other. 
In operation, a boiler is neither an open vessel nor a closed vessel. Instead, it is a vessel designed with restricted openings which allow steam to escape at a uniform rate while feedwater is being brought in at a uniform rate. After boiler operating pressure has been reached, therefore, the process of steam generation in a boiler takes place at constant pressure and constant temperature, if we disregard any fluctuations that may be caused by changes in steam demands. 
Although it is impossible to raise the temperature of the steam in the steam drum above the temperature of the water from which it is being generated, we can raise the temperature of the steam if we first remove the steam from contact with the water inside the steam drum and then add heat. Steam which has been heated above its saturation temperature for any given pressure is called &lt;em&gt;superheated steam&lt;/em&gt;, and the vessel in which the saturated steam is superheated is called a &lt;em&gt;superheater.&lt;/em&gt;The amount by which the temperature of the superheated steam exceeds the temperature of saturated steam at the same pressure is known as the &lt;em&gt;degree of superheat&lt;/em&gt;. For example, if saturated steam at a pressure of 620 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature of 490 °F is superheated to 790 °F, the degree of superheat is 300 °F. 
All ship’s propulsion boilers are equipped with superheaters. The primary advantage is that superheating the steam provides a greater temperature differential between the boiler and the condenser, thus allowing more heat to be converted to work at the turbines. Another advantage is that superheated steam is dry and therefore causes relatively little corrosion or erosion of machinery and piping. Also, superheated steam does not conduct heat as rapidly (and therefore does not lose heat as rapidly) as saturated steam. The increased efficiency which results from the use of superheated steam reduces the amount of fuel oil required to generate each pound of steam, and so reduces the space and weight requirements for the boilers. 
It should be noted, however, that most auxiliary machinery is designed to operate on saturated steam. Reciprocating machinery in particular requires saturated steam for the lubrication of internal moving parts of the steam end. Ship’s boilers, therefore, are designed to produce both saturated steam and superheated steam.

            <Title>Units of Measurement</Title>
            <Text>In engineering, temperature is commonly measured in degrees Fahrenheit. In this scale, the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure is designated 212°, and the freezing point is 32° with 180 equal degrees between. When working in the metric system, the Celsius scale is used. The Celsius scale (sometimes called the centigrade scale) uses zero as the freezing point of water and 100° as its boiling point, with 100 equal divisions or degrees between. 
To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit: multiply by 1.8 and add 32.  &lt;me&gt;°\mathrm{F} = (1.8 \times °\mathrm{C}) + 32°&lt;/me&gt;The British thermal unit (BTU) is used to measure heat. Originally, 1 BTU was defined as the quantity of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water through 1° on the Fahrenheit (F) scale. A similar unit called the calorie (cal) was originally defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water through 1° on the Celsius (C) scale. The BTU and calorie are still in use, but the original definitions have been abandoned by international agreement. These units are now defined in terms of the unit of energy called the &lt;q&gt;joule.&lt;/q&gt; By definition, 1 BTU is equal to 1054.886 joules, and 1 cal is equal to 4.18605 joules. As may be seen, the BTU is a much larger unit than the calorie; 1 BTU is equal to approximately 252 cal.

            <Title>Specific Heat</Title>
            <Text>In the discussion of sensible heat and latent heat, you may have noticed that it takes only 16 BTU to raise the temperature of 1 pound of ice from 0 °F to 32 °F that is, only 1/2 BTU for each degree of rise in temperature. However, we know that it takes 1 BTU (on the average) to raise the temperature of the same amount of water 1 °F. This difference occurs because the &lt;em&gt;specific heat&lt;/em&gt; of water is about twice the specific heat of ice. 
Specific heat is a thermal property of matter that must be determined experimentally for each substance. In general, we may say that specific heat is the property of matter; this explains the reason that equal quantities of thermal energy added to two different substances will not necessarily produce the same temperature rise, even when no change of state is involved. The specific heat of a substance is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of the substance 1 °F. For most engineering applications, specific heat is expressed in BTU per pound per degree Fahrenheit. In metric systems of measurement, specific heat is expressed in calories per gram per degree Celsius. Even though the units of measurement are different in the different systems, the &lt;em&gt;numerical value&lt;/em&gt; of specific heat for any given substance is the same in all systems. The specific heat of water is 1.00 in all systems.

            <Title>Effects of Electrical Current on the Human Body</Title>
            <Text>The severity of an electrical shock depends on the current’s magnitude, the duration, the contact area, and the path taken by the current through the body.  In extreme cases the shock causes failure of the normal action of the heart and lungs resulting in unconsciousness or death.
The shock current received obeys Ohm’s, so high voltages are always more dangerous.  But your body resistance is equally important.  Body resistance with dry skin may be above 100,000 ohms, However, if the skin is wet or broken, the body's resistance decreases to a few thousand ohms.

            <Title>Types of Respirators</Title>
            <Text>
OSHA divides respirators into two categories: 

&lt;figure xml:id="respirators1_jpg"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Air-purifying respirator&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image source="pics/ppe/respirators1.jpg" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;Air-purifying Respirators.&lt;/term&gt; These units have filters, cartridges, or canisters that remove contaminants from the air by passing the air through the air-purifying element before it reaches the user. Air purifying respirators are further divided into: &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Particulate Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which capture particles such as dusts, paint fumes, and mists, but do not protect against gases and vapors. The filters in particulate respirators generally work better as particles accumulate on the filter. If the filter becomes so clogged that it is difficult to breathe, it should be replaced. 
            &lt;em&gt;Gas and Vapor Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which use a chemical cartridge or canister to remove dangerous gases or vapors, but which do not protect against airborne particles. These units only protect against specific gases or vapors, and only provide protection as long as the filter’s absorbing capacity remains. 
            &lt;em&gt;Combination Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which can be used in atmospheres that contain both hazardous gases and particles. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure xml:id="respirators2_jpg"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Atmosphere-supplying respirators&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image source="pics/ppe/respirators2.jpg" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

   &lt;term&gt;Atmosphere-supplying Respirators.&lt;/term&gt; These units supply clean air directly to the user from a source other than the air surrounding the user. The types of air-supplying respirators are:    &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Air Supplied Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which have a hose which connects to a source of clean air under pressure. These units have no time limit on the air supply, but the hose limits the range and mobility of the user and is susceptible to damage. 
            &lt;em&gt;Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus&lt;/em&gt;, which have a wearable clean-air supply pack. These units have better mobility than the air-supplied respirator, but the clean air time is limited to the capacity of the tank. 
            &lt;em&gt;Combination Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which are similar to the air-supplied respirators, but also have a small, self-contained air supply which can be used for escape if the primary supply fails. 
   &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <Text>
Your feet are vulnerable to many potential hazards aboard ship. For example, slips and falls due to wet and slippery decks; heavy objects falling on or rolling over your foot because of the ship’s motion or accident; punctures caused by stepping on sharp objects; and potential electrical shock when your body is grounded through the soles of your shoes. In other industries, there are other hazards to consider, chemical exposure, high temperatures, molten metal splashes, static electricity, to name a few. Proper selection of footwear can minimize the danger of these hazards. 


OSHA has established regulations for safety shoe design, including impact and compression strength requirements, and they have mandated footwear requirements for many industries. For example, safety shoes or boots with impact protection are required to be worn in work areas where carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection are required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual materials handling cars) or other activities in which materials or equipment could potentially roll over an employee’s feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection are required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a foot injury. Although there are no specific OSHA requirements for safety footwear for marine engineers, it is nonetheless sensible to select and wear safety shoes based on the hazards found in the engine room.</Text>

            <Title>Practice Safe Lifting Techniques</Title>
            <Text>To lift heavy objects safely, follow these guidelines:
Assess the object's weight and plan your lift accordingly. Warm up your muscles with light exercises. Stand close to the object with feet shoulder-width apart, keeping your back straight and bending at the knees. Get a firm grip on the object and lift using the strength of your legs, not your back. Avoid twisting and keep the object close to your body. 
Don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Prioritize safety and listen to your body to prevent injuries.</Text>

            <Title>Internal Energy</Title>
            <Text>Although the term may be unfamiliar to you, you probably know more about &lt;em&gt;internal energy&lt;/em&gt; than you realize. Because molecules are constantly in motion, they exert a pressure on the walls of the pipe, boiler, cylinder, or other object in which they are contained. Also, the temperature of any substance arises from, and is directly proportional to, the activity of the molecules. Therefore, every time you read thermometers and pressure gages you are finding out something about the amount of internal energy contained in the substance. High pressures and temperatures indicate that the molecules are moving rapidly and that the substance therefore has a lot of internal energy. 
For most purposes, we will not need to distinguish between the two stored forms of thermal energy. Therefore, instead of referring to internal potential energy and internal kinetic energy, from now on we will simply use the term &lt;q&gt;internal energy.&lt;/q&gt; By internal energy, then, we will mean the sum total of all internal energy stored in the substance or system because of the motion of the molecules and because of the forces of attraction between molecules.

            <Title>Atmospheric Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere. At sea level the average pressure of the atmosphere is sufficient to support a column of mercury (Hg) 760.0 millimeters or 29.92 inches high. This is equivalent to a pressure of approximately 14.7 psi. This is known as the absolute pressure of the atmosphere, and is indicated by the unit &lt;em&gt;psia&lt;/em&gt; (pounds per square inch, absolute) 
A barometer is the device used to measure the pressure of the atmosphere, so the absolute pressure of the atmosphere is also known as the barometric pressure. When you hear a weather report, this is the value reported. The barometric pressure changes with weather conditions, but for most purposes aboard ship, this fact can be ignored, and we can assume that the atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia or 760 mm Hg. at all times. Notice, however, that the figure of 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute (psia.) represents the average atmospheric pressure at sea level, and does not always represent the actual pressure being exerted by the atmosphere at the moment that a gage is being read.

            <Title>Slips, trips and falls</Title>
            <Text>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, slips, trips, and falls cause nearly 700 fatalities per year and many more injurious accidents in the workplace,
Common trip and fall hazards include obstructions on walkways, such as cables, tools, or equipment left in pathways. Uneven surfaces, loose gratings, and obstructions, can also contribute to tripping incidents. Additionally, poor lighting, cluttered work areas, improper storage of materials, and inadequate lighting can increase the risk of trips and falls.  
Spilled liquids, oils, or water can make surfaces extremely slippery. Wet surfaces due to cleaning or maintenance activities, and the presence of loose debris are additional factors that can contribute to slip incidents.
Falls can be particularly dangerous when you are working at above the ground, such as on a ladder, scaffolding or staging.
Falling objects such as tools, equipment, materials, or debris can potentially cause serious injuries or fatalities.  When tools and are stored haphazardly or left unsecured, they are susceptible to falling on someone. 
Aboard ship, additional hazards exist due to the dynamic and often wet environment. Obstructions such as hatch combings, pad-eyes and container hold-downs can cause individuals to trip. Slip hazards arise from seawater or rainwater on deck surfaces, spilled liquids in galley areas, or lubricants used for machinery maintenance.  In rough seas, the motion of the ship can cause unsecured objects to fall, or cause you to lose your balance and fall. You must be particularly careful when working at heights or over the side. Always follow the old adage, “one hand for the ship and one hand for yourself.</Text>

            <Text>The International Safety Management Code (ISM Code) is a set of guidelines and regulations developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to ensure the safe operation of ships and the prevention of marine pollution. It was adopted in 1993 and became mandatory for all vessels engaged in international voyages in 1998.
The primary objective of the ISM Code is to establish a safety management system (SMS) on board ships and ashore, providing a framework for managing safety and minimizing risks in the maritime industry. The code applies to all types and sizes of vessels, including passenger ships, cargo ships, tankers, and offshore drilling units.
Under the ISM Code, both the ship and the company have specific obligations to ensure the effective implementation of safety management systems and adherence to safety standards. The obligations of the ship and the company are as follows:</Text>

Chapter 2 Packing, Transport and Storage
2.1 Packing
The purpose of packing is to protect goods during transport, transshipment and storage and to minimize the cost of such transport, transshipment and storage. In addition to the economic efficiency of packaging, safety - i.e. retention of the value of the packed goods - is of primary importance. All items will be packed in proper type of packing (box, skid, bundle, drum ,bare, etc.) by the supplier under his responsibility. Packing will be designed according to the type and quality of the item. The packing shall be strong enough to ensure maximum safety during shipping.
2.2 Transport
2.2.1 Protective Measures Prior to Transport
The following protective measures are taken before delivery of the machine from the factory. The same protective measures should be taken, whenever the machine is moved:
• All synchronous machines delivered as a unit are provided with transport locking device protecting the machine against damages during transport. The locking device must be attached whenever the machine is transported.
• Machined metal surfaces, such as the shaft extension, are coated with an anti-corrosive coating before delivery.
• The bearings are greased at the factory or during the tests prior to delivery. This gives sufficient protection against corrosion.
• During shipping the machine should be placed under deck.
2.2.2 Lifting the machine
Before the machine is lifted, ensure that suitable lifting equipment is available and that personnel are familiar with lifting work. The weight of the machine is shown on the rating plate, dimension drawing and packing list.
NOTE!
Use only the lifting lugs or eyes intended for lifting the complete machine. Do not use any small additional lifting lugs or eyes available, as they are there only for service purposes. These additional lifting lugs usually have caution name plates adjacent to them.
NOTE!
The center of gravity of machines with the same frame may vary due to different outputs, mounting arrangements and auxiliary equipment.
NOTE!
Check that eyebolts or the lifting lugs integrated with the machine frame are undamaged before lifting. Damaged lifting lugs must not be used.
NOTE!
Lifting eyebolts must be tightened before lifting. If needed, the position of the eyebolt must be adjusted with suitable washers.

Chapter 2 Packing, Transport and Storage
2.2.3 Lifting of unpacked machine
Lifting must be performed with great care and using slings long enough to assure the lifting angle requirements, see Figure 2-1. Lifting of unpacked machines. If the requirements are not met, there is a risk of damage.
• The machine must be lifted from its frame. Do not attempt to lift the machine from the top cover! • lift the complete generating set by the generator lifting points.
• When moving the generator always keep it in the horizontal plane, this will reduce the risk of the rotor falling out if 1-bearing design considered.
2.2.4 Checks upon arrival and unpacking
Check upon arrival
Inspect the machine and the package immediately upon arrival. Any transport damage must be photographed and reported immediately, i.e. within less than one (1) week after arrival, if the transport insurance is to be claimed. It is therefore important, that evidence of careless handling is checked and reported immediately to the transport company and the supplier. A machine that is not installed immediately upon arrival must not be left without supervision or without protective precautions. For more details, see Chapter 2.3.Storage.
Unpacking
Place the synchronous machine so that it does not hinder the handling of any other goods and on a flat, vibration-free surface. When the package has been removed, a check should be made to see that the machine is not damaged and that all accessories are included. Tick off the accessories on the packing list which is enclosed. If there is any damage, suspected damage, or if accessories are missing, please report this immediately to the supplier.

Chapter 2 Packing, Transport and Storage
2.3 Storage
2.3.1 Short term storage (less than 2 months)
The machine should be stored in a proper warehouse with a controllable environment. A good warehouse or storage place has:
• A stable temperature, preferably in the range from 10 oC (50 oF) to 50 oC (120 oF). If the anti- condensation heaters are energized, and the surrounding air is above 50 oC (120 oF), make sure that the machine is not overheated.
• Low relative air humidity, preferably below 75 %. The temperature of the machine should be kept above dew point to prevent moisture from condensing inside the machine. If the machine is equipped with anti-condensation heaters, they should be energized. Verify the operation of the anti-condensation heaters periodically. The anti-condensation heaters shall be de-energized when air temperature inside the machine enclosure exceeds +40 oC. Before connecting power supply to the anti-condensation heater, check the supply voltage and power. If the machine is not equipped with anti-condensation heaters, an alternative method of heating the machine and preventing moisture from condensing in the machine must be used. Machine can be e.g. heated by using power supply in the machine main terminals. Required DC voltage is approx. 5% of the rated voltage and current shall not exceed 30% of the nominal current.
• A stable support free from excessive vibrations and shocks. If vibrations are suspected to be too high, the machine should be isolated by placing suitable rubber blocks under the machine feet.
• Air which is ventilated, clean and free from dust and corrosive gases.
• Protection against harmful insects and vermin.
If the machine needs to be stored outdoors, the machine must never be left ‘as is’ in its transportation package. To store the machine outdoors:
• Take the machine out from its plastic wrap.
• Cover the machine to prevent rain from entering it. The cover should allow ventilation of the machine.
• Place the machine on at least 100 mm (4”) high rigid supports. This prevents moisture from entering the machine from below.
• Provide with good ventilation. If the machine is left in its transportation package, make large enough ventilation holes in the package.
• Use anti-condensation heaters or alternative method of heating for heating the machine and preventing moisture from condensing in the machine
• Protect from harmful insects and vermin.
2.3.2 Long term storage (2-6 months)
In addition to the measures described in Chapter 2.3.1. Short term storage (less than 2 months), some extra measures need taken depending on whether the machine is stored indoors or outdoors.
NOTE!
Be careful not to damage the seals or the bearings.
Storage indoors
To store the machine indoors:
• If the machine is stored in its transportation package, make big enough holes on the sides of the transportation package so that the D-end and ND-end of the machine are accessible.
• If the protection made by the manufacturer has been removed, protect the unpainted surfaces such as shaft extensions, coupling discs, coupling halves and jacking screws with suitable anti-corrosion agent. • If the machine has been delivered in fully assembled condition, turn the rotor approximately 10 revolutions once per every 3 months to maintain a protective oil film or grease on the bearing surfaces.

Chapter 2 Packing, Transport and Storage
Storage outdoors
• To store the machine outdoors:
• Take all the measures described in Storage indoors above.
• Cover the machine completely with a big enough waterproof cover.
• Remove the side and end covers of the machine.
• Protect the bare shaft surfaces and non-painted parts with anti-corrosive agent.
2.3.3 Very long term storage (over 6 months)
Clean all the protected surfaces listed in Chapter 2.3.1.Short term storage (less than 2 months) and Chapter 2.3.2. Long term storage (2-6 months), and renew the anti-corrosive treatment every 12 months. Otherwise follow the instructions for shorter storage periods.
2.3.4 Rolling bearings apply the following measures:
• Rolling bearings should be well lubricated during storage. For bearings without re-lubrication option this action is neglected.
• Turn the rotor 10 revolutions every three months to keep the bearings in good condition. Remove any possible transport locking device during turning the rotor.
• Machines may be provided with a locking device to protect the bearings against damage during transport and storage. Check the bearing locking device periodically.
2.3.5 Regular checks during storage
The following checks should be made regularly during storage.
Every month:
• Check that the anti-condensation heaters or alternative method of heating the machine is working. • Check that the ventilation works.
Every 3 months:
• Check the insulation resistance.
• Check that there is no corrosion on the surfaces. If corrosion is observed, remove the corrosion and protect the surfaces.
• Check that the anti-corrosion agents have not cracked.
2.3.6 Storage and care after installation
If the machine will not be in operation for a longer period of time after installation, the same measures as in Chapter 2.3.1. Short term storage (less than 2 months) should be applied. Remember to rotate the shaft 10 revolutions at least every 3 months.

3.5 Water cooler 3.5.1 General points
The purpose of the cooler is to remove heat losses of machine.(mechanical, ohmic, etc)
Water cooler is applied if a higher degree of protection is required from IP44 and over. The generators HFJ and HSJ can easily be converted for emergency operation as an open-circuit air-cooled machine if the coolant system or the cooling element fails. The cooler is located on the top of the machine.
The air is circulated by a fan fixed to the synchronous machine shaft.
3.5.2.1 Description of air-water double tube cooler
The double-tube technique keeps the cooling circuit from being affected by possible water leakage. The double tube provides a high safety level.
In case of leakage, the water goes from the inside of the internal tube to the coaxial space between the two tubes. The water is drained axially to a leakage chamber where it may activate a sensor.
An exchanger comprises a fin-tube block containing : • A steel frame
• A fin-tube block expanded mechanically to the tubes.
The tube bundle is roll-expanded in the end plates.
The water distribution in the tubes is provided by two removable water boxes.
A water box is equipped with collars for fitting the inlet and outlet lines. Neoprene seals ensure water tightness between the water boxes and the end plates.
3.5.2.2 Description of air-water single tube cooler
The single-tube technique keeps the vertical direction of cooling circuit from being affected by possible water leakage.
In case of leakage, the water goes from the inside of the tube to the frame. The water is drained to a leakage chamber where it may activate a sensor.

Chapter 4 Installation and alignment
4.1 Installation of generator
NOTICE
Experience has shown that any base mounted assemblies of generator and driven units temporarily aligned at the factory, no matter how rugged or deep in section may twist during shipment. Therefore, alignment must be checked after mounting.
The lubrication measures for normal bearings to be carried out before or during erection of the machines.
Install the machines so that the cooling air has free access and can escape unobstructed. Warm exhaust air must not be drawn in again.
Louver openings must face downwards to maintain the particular degree protection. Remove the shaft block (where applicable).
Follow the instruction attached to the shaft extension or shown in the terminal box.
The rotors are normally balanced dynamically by mans of a half feather key placed in the shaft extension.
Align the machines carefully and accurately balance the elements to be fitted on the shaft to ensure smooth and vibration-free running.
Place shims under the feet of the machines if necessary to prevent them from being stressed mechanically. Transmissions elements may be fitted and removed only by prevent them from falling out during shipment. A machine must not be commissioned without its transmission element having been fitted.
4.2 Alignment of generator
The correct alignment of machinery is very important for reducing the stress and vibration of the shaft and the wear of the bearing and coupling.
In case a coupling maker gives those instructions, it is recommended that the instructions be followed.
      4.2.1 Flexible Coupling
The flexible coupling set forth herein means the one driven through the rubber brush or the
leather brush including the gear coupling. In aligning the generator equipped with the sleeve bearing, attention is to be paid to the endplay of the generator bearing and to the position of the coupling. The
center of the generator bearing endplay is indicated by the end play indicator.
The bearing endplay can be equally divided by setting the end play indicator to the standard line of the shaft as shown in Fig. 4.1

Chapter 4 Installation and alignment
In case of key type coupling, the axial, parallel and angular tolerance are to be acceptable by coupling element property. In case of flange type coupling, coupling works should be carried out in accordance with standard instructions of the engine maker. (HHI alignment standard as shown on Fig. 4.2)
Fig. 4.2 HHI alignment standard
CAUTION
NOTICE
Experience has shown that any base mounted assemblies of generator and driven units temporarily aligned at the factory, no matter how rugged or deep in section may twist during shipment. Therefore, alignment must be checked after mounting.
4.2.2 Rigid Coupling
In case of the sleeve bearing, when both flanges are connected to each other, the endplay indicator is referred to install the flexible coupling in order to determine the position of the generator.
4.2.3 Alignment
NOTE !
The foot plane is of concern for each unit of rotating equipment. Checked driven equipment if necessary.
Alignment is made to bring the shaft centers of the generator and machine combined with it into the same line; the parallel and eccentricity are measured through the coupling. Generally a thickness gauge or a taper gauge is used in
measuring the parallel, and in
         In case the coupling is used, it may be considered that the rotor can be easily moved in the axial direction. In fact, however, it hardly slides in the axial direction at the coupling as the torque grows greater. When by some reason the rotor has undergone some axial movement, and the coupling does not provide enough slip to allow the rotor to return to the magnetic center of the generator, it will continue to operate with the bearing end in contact with the shoulder of the journal.
             measuring the eccentricity, a dial gauge is to be fitted to the coupling on one side; the
both shafts are to be turned by 0 deg, 90 deg, 180 deg and 270 deg; and the dial gauge
reading is to be taken at the four points as shown in Fig. 4.3 The alignment accuracy is to
be generally 0.025 mm or less (both plate and circle).

Chapter 5 Electrical Connections
5.1 General information
Electrical connections are made after the mechanical installation and alignment procedures.
The electrical connections included the connection of main and auxiliary cables, earthing cables and possible external components.
5.2 Connection of main power cables and neutral cable
The main terminal box is typically supplied drilled plate with cable glands if customer send us specification of main &amp; aux cables. If not, cable gland plates will be supplied as blind. The customer or a third party is therefore responsible for this. The stator terminals are marked with the letters U, V and W according to IEC 60034-8. Stripping, splicing and insulating of the cables must be performed in accordance with the instructions delivered by the cable manufacturer. The lugs should not be permanently tightened by bus bars, but only attached (for checking of insulation resistance). The cables must be supported so that no stress is applied to the bus bars in the terminal box. When three- phase cables are used, the prescribed distance must be maintained between the leads at intersections. Bracing and spacers should be used if necessary.
5.3 Earth connection
The ground cable can be connected inside of the main terminal box. The earth connection of generator frame is located on the foot.
5.4 Insulation distance of main power connections
The connections of the main power cables are designed to withstand demanding operation conditions where the insulators can be subjected to dirt, humidity and surge voltages. In order to ensure lasting and trouble free running, it is therefore important that local requirements or other applicable standards for the insulation distances are met. If no local requirements or other applicable standards are available, it is suggested that the minimum insulation distances mentioned below table. Recommended minimum insulation distances are used. These distances apply both for insulation distances between two different phases, and for insulation distances between one phase and the earth. The air insulation distance is the shortest distance through air between two points with different electrical potential. The surface insulation distance is the shortest distance along surfaces next to each other between two points with different electrical potential.

8.5. Maintenance of bearing 8.5.1 Operating description
NOTICE
Before starting, check if the bearing is filled with oil or not to the necessary oil level.
CAUTION
Prolonged operation at extremely slow rotation speeds (several rpm) without lubrication could seriously damage for the service life of the bearing.
CAUTION
8.5.2 Oil change
8.5.2.1 Ring lubrication system
Check the bearing temperature regularly.
The governing factor is not the temperature rise itself, but the temperature variations over a period of time. If abrupt variations without apparent cause are noticed, shut down the machine and renew the oil.
The lubrication oil indicated on the data plate is used for starting up the machines at an ambient temperature of above +5°C.
At lower temperatures (to about -20°C), it is necessary to preheat the oil.
If the ambient temperature is below -20°C another type of oil according to the special conditions is
used.
Do not mix oils of different grades.
Recommended oil changing intervals are about 3000 and 6000 operating hours in the case of intermittent and continuous duty.
When cleaning, first flush the bearings with kerosene and then with oil.
NOTE !
If the lubrication oil contains unusual residues or its color looks changed, bearings shall be inspected.
Pour in the kerosene and oil through the top sight-glass hole.
Leave the drain open until all the kerosene has been removed and clean oil runs out. Now, plug the drain and fill the bearing with oil up to the center of the lateral inspection glass.
When the machine has run up to speed, check the oil ring through the top inspection glass to see that it rotates correctly, and check the bearing temperature.
Should the bearing temperature not drop to the normal value after the oil change, it is recommended that the surfaces of the bearing shells be inspected.
                    If the bearing temperature exceeds the normal operating value by 15 K, stop the machine immediately. Inspect the bearing and determine the causes. Setting values of a safety device

Chapter 8 Maintenance
If the bearings are fitted with thermometers for checking the bearing temperature, fill the thermometer well in the upper bearing shell for thermo feeler with oil to improve heat transfer and top up with oil every time the lubricating oil is changed.
8.5.2.2 Forced lubrication system
Check the bearing temperature regularly.
The governing factor is not the temperature rise itself, but the temperature variations over a period of time. If abrupt variations without apparent cause are noticed, shut down the machine and renew the oil.
Recommended oil changing intervals are about 20,000 operating hours.
After the machine has come to a stand-still, the old oil is drained out of the bearings and oil tank and operate the oil pump with kerosene for a short time and then with oil to clean the bearings.
For the oil pump, the oil tank, the cooler and the pipe lines: Pour in the kerosene and then the oil through the filling opening of the oil tank. Leave the drains open from time to time until all the kerosene has been removed and clean oil runs out of the bearings and oil tank. Then plug the drains and fill the tank with oil. Should the bearing temperature not drop to the normal value after the oil change, it is recommended that the surfaces of the bearing shells be inspected.

8.6. Maintenance of stator and rotor winding
The windings of rotating electrical machines are subjected to electrical, mechanical and thermal stress. The windings and insulation gradually age and deteriorate due to these stresses. Therefore, the service life of the machine often depends on the insulation durability.
Many processes leading to damages can be prevented or at least slowed down with appropriate maintenance and regular testing. This character offers a general description on how to perform basic cleaning, maintenance and test.
Before conducting any maintenance work on the electrical windings, general electrical safety precautions are to be taken and local regulations are to be respected in order to prevent personnel accidents.
Independent test and maintenance instructions can also be found in the following international standards:
• IEEE Std 43-2000, IEEE Recommended Practice for Testing insulation Resistance of Rotating Machines
8.6.1 Cleaning of stator and rotor winding
Insulated windings should be kept reasonably clean of dirt, oil, metal particles and other contaminants. A film of dirty oil tends to accumulate particles that may interfere with satisfactory ventilation of the machine.
Access the rotor and stator assemblies and then clean windings using one or all of the following methods.

Chapter 8 Maintenance
W ARNING
Use cleaning solution in an open or well-ventilated area; avoid breathing fumes. Keep away from open flames. Do not use a wire brush or a steel blade scraper to clean parts. Do not use gasoline, fuel oil or kerosene for cleaning.
8.6.1.1 Cleaning method
1. Vacuum Cleaning
To remove dust, dirt and particles the use of suction is preferable to blowing out with compressed air, since there is less possibility of damage to insulation and less chance of blowing conducting or harmful particles into areas that may later result in damage during operation.
2. Compressed Air Cleaning
Compressed air to blow out loose dust and particles from inaccessible areas such as air ducts and between stator end turns.
3. Solvent Cleaning
Solvent Cleaning: A method for removing all visible oil, grease, soil, drawing and cutting compounds, and other soluble contaminants from steel surfaces. It is intended that solvent cleaning be used prior to the application of paint and in conjunction with surface preparation methods specified for the removal of rust, mill scale, or paint.
3.1 System Procedure Before Solvent Cleaning
Prior to solvent cleaning, remove foreign matter (other than grease and oil) by one or a combination of the following: brush with stiff fiber or wire brushes, abrade, scrape, or clean with solutions of appropriate cleaners, provided such cleaners are followed by a fresh water rinse.
3.2 Methods of Solvent Cleaning
Remove heavy oil or grease first by scraper. Then remove the remaining oil or grease by either of the following methods:
1) Wipe or scrub the surface with rags or brushes wetted with solvent. Use clean solvent and clean rags or brushes for the final wiping. Acceptable solvents are lacquer thinner and denatured alcohol.
2) Steam clean, using detergents or cleaners and follow by steam or fresh water wash to remove detrimental residues.
3) Solvent cleaned surfaces should be primed or prepared as specified before any detrimental corrosion or recontamination occurs.
4. Steam Cleaning
To provide general guidelines for steam cleaning electrical winding, stator and rotor that have been processed through a complete resin impregnation and cure process.
(Do not steam clean green windings.)
4.1 Scope
1) Cleaning and removal of foreign materials that have accumulated near or on the windings of stators, rotors, exciters, armatures.
2) Cleaning of the outside of these units; provided the defined bake times required to dry the unit after cleaning is adhered to.
4.2 Definitions (optional)
1) Green winding – any winding that does not have a fully cured application of resin or varnish on it.
4.3 Special Tools Required
1) Vacuum Cleaner – preferably with a clean filter so any collected materials can be bagged and saved for evaluation.
2) Preheated oven large enough to accommodate the part.
3) Water containment system to assure water is diverted to a location it can be recovered from and properly disposed of.
4) Calibrated temperature measuring device.

Chapter 8 Maintenance
1. Electrical Windings
• Remove any baffles, shrouds, or other feature that may be removed that could block access to the
areas that require cleaning.
• Vacuum the loose debris from the unit. (DO NOT use an air hose at this operation.)
If practical, use a vacuum with a bag and send the bag with materials collected to QC when task is complete (this is most important for warranty repair work).
• Initiate pre-heat of oven at 50 – 65 0C before starting the steam cleaning process.
The oven must be preheated before placing the just cleaned part into it. Oven must have calibrated
controls and have a temperature recording chart in use.
• Do not begin steam cleaning frame until the steam cleaner spray is clearly a mixture of steam and water. (Do not use soap or detergent.)
• Make sure the waste water is diverted to a location where it can be contained.
• Make sure no unauthorized personnel are in the work area for safety reasons. • To avoid the risk of damage from the steam cleaning process:
1) The nozzle should typically be held 305 to 610 mm from any coil. The practical minimum Distance from nozzle to coils is 105 mm.
2) Avoid a direct spray onto any temperature sensing device or its leads.
3) Only turn the stream of steam on when the wand or nozzle is moving and turn it off before it stops moving.
4) The motion of the wand should create a sweeping type action. 5) Do not apply a continuous stream to any point on the windings.
• Start cleaning at the top surfaces and gradually work down. Repeat the process several times as
needed. Estimated time to clean parts effectively is a minimum of 15minutes plus 3 minutes for every 450 kg of mass. The actual time will vary based on the condition of the unit, but everyeffort should be made to completely clean the unit so a second cleaning can be avoided.
• Place the unit into a preheated 50 – 65 0C oven as soon as possible, but not to exceed 90 minutes from the time the cleaning operation is complete.
• Have inspection visually verify the unit is clean and free of damage.
1) Look for any damage to coils or leads. Highest risk is damage caused by high pressure fluids hitting coil wedges, temperature sensors, space heaters, and coils.
2) Look for evidence of residual debris or dirt that may not have been removed by the steam cleaning process. If a possible problem area exists, sample the area by applying a strip of masking tape to the area, removing and attaching the masking tape to clear plastic film.
Identify the location the sample was collected from and forward samples with this work instruction.
2. Stator and Rotor cores
• Remove any baffles, shrouds, or other feature, that may be removed, that could block access to the areas that require cleaning.
• Vacuum the loose debris from the unit. (DO NOT use an air hose at this operation.)
• Remove any oil, grease or similar materials from the unit with a combination of scrapers, cloths,
solvents, or high pressure fluid stream at room temperature or cooler.
• Preheat the part in an oven at 105 – 120 0C before starting the steam cleaning process. The oven
must be preheated before placing the part into it. Oven must have calibrated controls and have a temperature recording chart in use.
• Do not begin steam cleaning frame until the steam cleaner spray is clearly a mixture of steam and water. (Do not use soap or detergent.) Check temperature of fitting as it enters the flow control handle.
I should be greater than 65 0C.
• Make sure the waste water is diverted to a location where it can be contained.

8.6.2 The correct operating temperature
The correct temperature of the windings is ensured by keeping the exterior surfaces of the machine Clean, by seeing to the correct operation of the cooling system by monitoring the temperature sensors.
For air cooled machines it is important to the cleanliness of air inlets and outlets of air filter.
If the machine is equipped with the temperature detectors, stator operating temperature must be monitored. Significant temperature differences among the detectors or high temperature could be a sign of damage in the windings.
8.6.3 Insulation resistance test
During general maintenance work and before the machine is started up for the first time or after long standstill period, the insulation resistance of stator and rotor windings must be measured.
The insulation resistance measurement provides information about the humidity and dirtiness of the insulation. Based upon this information, correct cleaning and drying actions can be determined.
For new machines with dry winding, the insulation resistance is very high. The resistance can, however, be extremely low if the machine has been subjected to incorrect transportation and storage conditions and humidity, or if the machine is operated incorrectly.
NOTE !
Windings should be earthed briefly immediately after measurement in order to avoid risk of electric shock.
Conversion of measured insulation value
In order to be able to compare measured insulation resistance value, the values are stated at 40°C. The actual measured value is therefore converted to a corresponding 40°C value with the help of the following figure. The use of this figure should be limited to temperature near to the standard value of 40°C, since large deviations from it could result in errors.

• Rc : Insulation resistance value corrected to 40°C
• Rt : Measured insulation resistance at temperature t°C
• Kt : Insulation resistance temperature coefficient at temperature t°C
Example :
Rt = 30 MΩ measured at 20°C Kt = 0.5
R40 = 0.5 x 30 = 15 MΩ
General consideration
The following consideration should be noted, before deciding any actions based upon the insulation resistance tests :
• If the measured value is considered too low, the winding must be cleaned and /or dried, see Chapter 8.6.7 Drying for details.
• Machines, that are suspected to have a moisture problem, should be dried carefully independent of the measured insulation resistance value.
• The insulation resistance value will decrease when the winding temperature rises.
• The resistance is halved for every 10-15°C temperature rise.
Minimum values for insulation resistance
The limit values for minimum insulation resistance and critical insulation resistance(for measurement at a winding temperature of 25°C) and for measuring voltage can be derived from the following table depending on the rated voltage for the machine.

         Stator winding insulation resistance measurement
The insulation resistance is measured using an insulation resistance meter. The test voltage is 500V or 1000 VDC. The test time is 1 minute, after which the insulation resistance value is recorded. Before the insulation resistance test is conducted, check that :
CAUTION
If any CT or PT of generator is earthed, it should be removed before megger test.
• Opening the side cover of cable gland (or main terminal) box on generator top side. • You can see the generator main bus bars.
• Connect the each terminal of Megger Tester between Main Bus Bar (One Phase) and frame
earthling.
• If the measurement value is greater than 100 MOHM, the condition of generator stator winding is
O.K. If not so good, please sufficiently dry the generator windings using the space heater installed into generator body. And then retry the megger test.
• After megger test, please connect the jumper line between main bus bar and frame earthling in order to remove the voltage charged into the generator stator windings.
(Please note that this action is for the safety.)
Insulation resistance measurement of the rotor field winding and excitation machine
The test voltage for the rotor winding and excitation machine is 100V or 500VDC. When testing the windings of the rotors:
• Short circuit the rectifier before measuring
• Measure the rotor winding temperature if possible or estimate otherwise measurement temperature of the rotor winding.
• Opening the air intake side (or inspection cover) of frame body.
• You can see the rotating rectifier's rings on the generator rotor part
• Connect the each terminal of 500V Megger Tester between Rectifier Ring (for Rotating Diode) and Frame Eathing.
• If the measurement value is greater than 10 MOHM, the condition of generator rotor winding
is O.K. If not so good, please sufficiently dry the generator windings using the space heater installed into generator body. And then retry the megger test.
• After megger test, please connect the jumper line between rectifier ring and frame earthing in order to remove the voltage charged into the generator rotor windings.
(Please note that this action is for the satiety.) When testing the stator winding of the excitation machine: • Disconnect the power supply cables from the voltage source.
• Connect the insulation resistance meter between the stator winding and the frame of machine as shown in below figure.

8.6.4 Polarization index for Medium voltage machine
For the polarization index test the insulation resistance is measured after the voltage has been applied for 15 seconds and 1 minute (or 1 minute and 10 minutes). The polarization index test is less dependent on the temperature is below 50°C, it may be considered independent of temperature. High temperatures can cause unpredictable changes in the polarization index. Therefore the test should not be used in temperature above 50°C.
Dirt and humidity accumulating in the winding normally reduces the insulation resistance, and the polarization index, as well as their dependence on temperature.
There are several rules for determining the lowest acceptable value with which the machine can be safely started. For the polarization index (PI), the values usually range between 1 and 4. Value close to 1 indicate that the windings are humid and dirty.
The minimum PI value for class H stator winding is more than 2, where PI = 𝑅1𝑚𝑖𝑛 or PI = 𝑅10𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑅1.5𝑠 𝑅1𝑚𝑖𝑛
Note !
If the 1 minute insulation resistance is above 5000 MΩ, it can be disregarded.
8.6.5 High voltage test
A voltage test is used to check for electrically weak spots in the windings that may lead to insulation failure during servicing. It is carried out during major inspections, troubleshooting and repairs.
     8.6.6 Visual winding inspection
Winding inspection give information on:
• The rate of contamination ; presence of dirt and humidity
• Stability of bracings, vibration marks, and cracking Hyundai Electric &amp; Energy Systems, Co., Ltd
Rotating Machines
 40

Chapter 8 Maintenance
• Marks of overheating
• Marks of movement
• Tightness of the slot wedges
• Winding overhangs and their supports
When examining the contamination, particular attention should be paid to the open creep age surfaces, as the insulation resistance is easily affected by the dirt accumulating there.
Accumulating dirt blocks the coil gaps and air ducts, and thus diminishes the cooling capacity of the machine. As a result, the winding temperature rises, and aging may speed up considerably.
Mechanical strain, vibration, and shocks may cause cracks on the edges of the supports, bindings, and around slot ends. Loose supports and slot wedges are signs of further deterioration. Check for abrasion marks and powder near the supports, bindings, and at the slot ends. Complete loosening of the slot wedges and bent coils are serious problem that must be rectified immediately.
Humidity in the winding often causes e.g. rust on iron, drop marks, dripping, and wetting marks on dirt layers. Brush-shaped patterns, often charred and left behind by the tracking currents, warm of an approaching failure. In rare cases, the conductors are corroded.
Marks of the electrical effects (apart from tracking current marks), are usually hidden inside the slot and conductor insulations.
The following are marks of overheating:
Copper in the damper windings grows darker (darkening may also be due to the gases in the environment), and it oxidizes.
• Core laminations of the rotor become blue (over 350°C)
• There are color differences in the fastening bolts of synchronous machines.
• Insulation may shrink or split (usually over 200°C), bindings may crack (over 200°C), and polyester film or fibers may melt (over 250°C).
Prolonged periods over temperatures cause premature aging. The insulating materials become brittle and darken in the early, stages. As a result, the windings split, disintegrate, and fracture.
8.6.7 Drying
The winding must be dried:
• After washing (especially water wash and rinse)
• If they have become humid in use or during a standstill.
Drying should always be started with an external blower or warm air. Other means should be
attempted, only if blower and warm air do not suffice.
During drying, the rate of temperature rise of the winding should not exceed 5 K per hour, and the final temperature should not exceed 105°C. A sudden temperature rise or a too high final temperature can cause steam to be formed in the cavities of the winding, which in turn can destroy the windings. During the drying process, the temperature should be monitored periodically, and the insulation resistance should be measured at regular intervals.
A very wet machine should be dismantled and the winding dried in an oven. Every part should be checked. If the machine is not very wet, the winding can be dried by passing a current through it.
  Hyundai Electric &amp; Energy Systems, Co., Ltd
Rotating Machines
41

Chapter 8 Maintenance
If the winding is dried by passing a current through it, the source of electricity can be e.g. a welding machine or a similar device.
Note !
Direct current or alternate current can be used. The current must not exceed 25% of the nominal current, which is indicated on the rating plate on the machine. The winding temperature should also be continuously monitored.
When drying in an oven, the temperature rise and the maximum temperature should be monitored carefully. The oven temperature should be around 90°C for 12 to 16 hours and then 105°C, for 6 to 8 hours. These times can vary, and the correct time should be monitored with and insulation resistance test.
Drying in an oven with good ventilation is the most effective technique. Unfortunately this is not usually possible at the machine’s operating site. Therefore, either hot-air-blow or heating the windings with current should be used.
An insulation resistance test should be performed after drying the windings. When drying is started, the insulation resistance decreases due to the temperature rise. As the drying continuous, however, the insulation resistance increases until it reaches a stable value.
8.6.8 Maintenance related to electrical performance, excitation, control and Protection
8.6.8.1 Protection trips
The synchronous machine needs to be protected with alarms or alarms/trips in case of abnormal running conditions, both electrical and mechanical. Some of these protections can be reset and the machine restarted directly as the fault is located.
8.6.8.2 Automatic voltage regulator (AVR)
The automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is important in controlling and protecting the machine, and problems in connections or settings of the AVR might lead to different types of operational faults. For detailed information about AVR see Annex 2 - AVR manual.
8.6.8.3 Insulation resistance measurement for auxiliaries
To ensure correct operation of the machines protections and other auxiliaries, their condition can also be determined by an insulation resistance test, however this is not recommended.
8.6.8.4 Diode fault
If a diode in the rotating rectifier fails, the generator must be tripped. To determine and locate a faulty diode:
Open the rectifier covers at the non-drive end of the machine and measure the voltage with an ohm- meter over one of the diodes.
If diode failure is detected, disconnect all diodes and test them separately to locate the faulty diode. To replace faulty diodes:
• Open the rectifier cover at Non-Drive end of the machine.
• Disconnect the wires connected to the diodes and exciter winding connection cables.
• Check the condition of the diodes by measuring the voltage over a diode in both directions • Replace the damaged diode(s).
• Clean the contact surface and apply electric joint compound.
       Hyundai Electric &amp; Energy Systems, Co., Ltd

Chapter 8 Maintenance
• Fasten the diode(s). Bind the connection leads of the diodes as on original assembly. • Check fastening and locking of all rectifier bridge components.
• Make sure that no tools etc. are inside the machine and close the service covers.
After replacing the diodes, the condition of the diodes can be checked by comparing no-load excitation current to commissioning values. A diode failure result as a significant increase or decrease in excitation current.

The National Safety Council has found that hands are the body part most frequently injured on the job. Accidents to the hand fall into these categories: abrasions, cuts, punctures, crushes, contact with moving machinery, burns, and chemical injuries. Gloves and hand protection are available to protect you from nearly all of these hazards. However, glove selection must be based on performance characteristics of the gloves, conditions, durations of use, and hazards present. One type of glove will not work in all situations. 


In the engine room, particular hazards include high temperatures and moving machinery. Long sleeved shirts are advisable to protect your arms, and you should always have a pair of work gloves available to use when necessary to protect your hands when working around hot pipes. Special high temperature gloves should always be worn when changing burners, and the appropriate chemical resistant gloves should be worn when working with burner cleaning and boiler chemicals. You should also pay particular attention to avoid contact with moving parts of machinery or power tools with moving parts, and insure that safety guards are always in place. Gloves should always be inspected for damage before use.

Correct adjustment and fit of the your hard hat is required for maximum safety. The internal cradle of the headband and sweatband forms a suspension system which keeps the helmet away from the head and cushions against impact. The headband must be adjusted to the right size in order to provide sufficient clearance between the shell and the headband. 


Before using a hard hat you should inspect it for signs of damage or abuse of the helmet or any of its parts. A damaged helmet reduces the margin of safety the hat was designed to supply, and should be replaced immediately.

            <Text>Fatigue, which refers to a state of extreme tiredness and lack of energy, can pose several risks.   The primary cause of fatigue is insufficient or poor-quality sleep.  To avoid fatigue, it's important to prioritize adequate rest and sleep, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
Other factor which can contribute to fatigue include: medical conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, anemia, and thyroid disorders; depression and anxiety, and unhealthy lifestyle habits, including inadequate physical activity, poor nutrition, excessive caffeine or alcohol intake, and smoking. Certain medications have fatigue as a side effect. 
The negative consequences of fatigue include:</Text>

            <Text>Ships are dangerous places to live and work for many reasons, some general, and some specific to the marine environment.  These include dynamic and unpredictable marine conditions, extended working hours with small crews, hazardous cargos, isolated work settings, and the potential for fire, explosion, collision, and sinking.
Everyone aboard needs to be aware of the potential hazards, actively engage in safety measures, and be prepared to respond to emergencies.  Safety is not solely the responsibility of designated officers or management but is a collective responsibility shared by all onboard. 
In this chapter we discuss some of the hazards you may encounter aboard ship, approaches to managing and reducing risk, and some things you can do personally do to protect yourself, your shipmates, the vessel, and the environment.

            <Text> Over the years, many marine engineers have suffered permanent hearing loss due to hours of exposure to the high noise levels in the engine room. You can prevent the loss of your own hearing by using proper hearing protection such as earplugs and earmuffs religiously whenever you are exposed to loud noises. 
Your ear is a delicate instrument which contains thousands of fine hair cells called cilia to detect sounds. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can injure or break these cells or even tear off groups of these cells. Since the hair cells don’t ever repair themselves, when enough of them are damaged, a hearing loss results. 
Short, intense, sounds such as an explosion can cause immediate and permanent hearing loss, but most hearing loss occurs gradually due to prolonged exposure to high noise levels. Most of the time this loss is so gradual that you are not even aware that it is occurring. Hearing loss is progressive and will continue to get worse as you continue to expose yourself to a noisy environment, but if you can avoid further exposure, the hearing loss won’t get any worse. 
Permanent hearing loss is not the only hazard associated with noisy environments. Tinnitus is a condition where a ringing or roaring sound is heard continuously in one or both ears. Tinnitus occurs when the hair cells are damaged in such a way that they produce sound signals to the brain even in the absence of actual stimulation. This noise is sometimes described as like having a cricket permanently stuck in your ear, and is very annoying. 
Sound intensity is measured in units of &lt;em&gt;decibels&lt;/em&gt; (dB). The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale in which 0 dB indicates the quietest sound that can be heard by a normal person. A quiet library is about 20 dB. A normal conversation occurs at a sound level of about 60 dB. A lawnmower produces about 85 dB, and at this level you should be wearing hearing protection. Sandblasting or a rock concert has a sound intensity of about 115 dB. At this level hearing damage can occur after only about 15 minutes of unprotected exposure. 
According to OSHA regulations, when the 8 hour average noise exposure is above 85 dB, employers are required to institute a noise monitoring program, provide adequate hearing protectors, and ensure employees wear them. Continual, unprotected exposure to noises louder than 85 decibels for 8 hours or more can be dangerous, and may result in hearing loss. 
You can easily tell if you should be wearing hearing protection. If you find yourself in a situation where it is too noisy to carry on a conversation at arms length, or if you notice that your ears ring or feel plugged for a time after leaving a noisy environment, you can be sure that you should have been wearing your hearing protection.

            <Title>Types of Eye Protection</Title>
            <Text>
The three main types of eye protection for general maintenance are safety glasses, goggles, and face shields. In addition, when welding, specialized equipment must be used to protect your eyes. Each method of eye protection has its own advantages and disadvantages. 


   &lt;term&gt;Safety Glasses.&lt;/term&gt; Safety glasses are lightweight glasses that have shatter resistant lenses made of materials like polycarbonate or propionate plastic and often have side shields attached to the side pieces. Safety glasses are designed to stop flying objects such as chips, fragments, sand, and dirt from injuring your eyes. They also can provide laser light filtration to prevent reflections from the laser entering the eye and causing retinal burns. Safety glasses can be purchased with prescription lenses including bifocals if necessary. 


The main advantage of safety glasses is that they are lightweight and relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The provide little to no protection from liquids or vapors, and some flying particles may get around the side shields. 

&lt;figure xml:id="goggles_jpg"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Types of Eye Protection&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image source="pics/ppe/goggles.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

   &lt;term&gt;Goggles.&lt;/term&gt; Goggles provide more complete protection of the eye than safety glasses, since they protect against both frontal and side impact. They come in two different types, vented and non-vented. Vented goggles are used to protect your eyes from splashes and flying objects, while Non-vented Goggles additionally protect your eyes from hazardous vapors, mists, and fumes. 


   &lt;term&gt;Face Shields.&lt;/term&gt; Face shields are designed to augment other types of eye protection and are not meant to be a stand alone form of eye protection. Face shields are used to protect your entire face with goggles on under the shield to catch any liquids that might make it past the shield.

            <Text>A confined space is defined by OSHA as a space that has limited or restricted means of entry, is not designed for continuous occupancy, and is large enough and configured so that a person can enter the space and maneuver well enough to perform tasks.  
Confined spaces pose several hazards that can endanger workers who enter  them due to their limited entry and exit points, restricted airflow, and potential for hazardous atmospheres. 
On ships, some examples of confined spaces include:  Cargo and fuel tanks, cofferdams, pressure vessels, sewage tanks, and void spaces.

            <Text>You will also find another kind of pressure unit, which appears to be a length. These units include inches of water, inches of mercury (Hg), or the height of some other liquid of known density. These units, while measured in length units, still represent a pressure. The length describes the pressure exerted by a column of liquid of the given height, and is known as the &lt;em&gt;head&lt;/em&gt;. 
For example, a pressure reading of 1 inch of water (1 in. H₂O) means that the exerted pressure is equal to the pressure exerted by a column of water 1 inch high, or that a column of water in a U-tube would be displaced 1 inch by the pressure being measured. Similarly, a reading of 12 inches of mercury (12 in. Hg) means that the measured pressure is sufficient to support a column of mercury 12 inches high. 
What is really being expressed, even though it is not mentioned in the pressure unit, is the fact that a certain quantity of material (water, mercury, etc.) of known density will exert a certain definite force upon a specified area. Pressure is still force per unit area even if the pressure unit refers to the height of some liquid.

            <Title>Power</Title>
            <Text> &lt;em&gt;Power&lt;/em&gt; is the rate of doing work. The amount of work done has nothing at all to do with how long it takes to do it. When you lift a weight of 1 pound through a distance of 1 foot, you have done 1 foot-pound of work, regardless of whether you do it in half a second or half an hour. A device which can do a lot of work quickly is powerful. The common unit of measurement for power is the &lt;em&gt;horsepower&lt;/em&gt; (hp). By definition, 1 horsepower is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute or 550 foot-pounds of work per second. Thus a machine that is capable of doing 550 foot-pounds of work per second is said to be a 1-horsepower machine. (As you can see, your horsepower rating would not be very impressive if you did 1 foot-pound of work in half an hour. Figure it out. It works out to be just a little more than one-millionth of a horsepower.)

Head injuries are caused by falling or flying objects, or by bumping your head against a fixed object. Head protection, in the form of protective hats, must do two things – resist penetration and absorb the shock of the blow. This is accomplished by making the shell of the hat of a material hard enough to resist the blow, and by utilizing a shock-absorbing lining composed of headband and crown straps to keep the shell away from the wearer’s skull. Protective hats are also used to protect against electric shock.

            <Text>Can you define energy? Although everyone has a general idea of the meaning of energy, a good definition is hard to find. Most commonly, perhaps, energy is defined as the &lt;q&gt;ability of a system to do work.&lt;/q&gt; This is not a very complete definition. Energy can produce other effects which cannot possibly be considered &lt;q&gt;work.&lt;/q&gt; For example, heat can flow from one object to another without doing work; yet heat is a form of energy, and the process of heat transfer is a process that produces an effect. 
A better definition of energy, therefore, states that &lt;q&gt;energy is the capacity for producing an effect.&lt;/q&gt; Energy exists in many forms. For convenience, we usually classify energy according to the size and nature of the bodies or particles with which it is associated. Thus we say that &lt;em&gt;Mechanical energy&lt;/em&gt; is the energy associated with large bodies or objects, usually, things that are big enough to see. &lt;em&gt;Thermal energy&lt;/em&gt; is energy associated with molecules. &lt;em&gt;Chemical energy&lt;/em&gt; is energy that arises from the forces which bind the atoms together in a molecule, Chemical energy is demonstrated whenever combustion or any other chemical reaction takes place. &lt;em&gt;Electro-magnetic&lt;/em&gt; energy is energy that is associated with the electron and charged particles. Light, x-rays and radio waves are examples of electro-magnetic energy. &lt;em&gt;Nuclear energy&lt;/em&gt; is associated with the particles in the nucleus, and is governed by Einstein’s famous equation E = mc^2nEach of these types of energy (mechanical energy, thermal energy, etc.) must also be classified as being either stored energy, or energy in transition.  &lt;em&gt;Stored energy&lt;/em&gt; can be thought of as energy that is actually &lt;q&gt;contained in&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;stored in&lt;/q&gt; a substance or system. There are two kinds of stored energy: potential energy, and kinetic energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the relative &lt;em&gt;positions&lt;/em&gt; of two or more objects or particles, we call it potential energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the relative &lt;em&gt;velocities&lt;/em&gt; of two or more objects or particles, we call it kinetic energy.

            <Title>Heat Transfer</Title>
            <Text>Heat can flow from one substance to another only when a temperature difference exists. Heat flow can occur only from a higher temperature to a lower temperature. When two objects at different temperatures are placed in contact with each other (or near each other), heat flows from the warmer object to the cooler one until both are at the same temperature. Heat transfer occurs at a faster rate when there is a larger temperature difference between the two objects. As the temperature difference approaches zero, the rate of heat transfer approaches zero. 
Conduction, radiation, and convection are usually considered to be the three methods by which heat transfer can occur. It is more accurate, however, to consider conduction and radiation as the two basic methods of heat transfer and to consider convection separately as a special process which involves movement within a mass of fluid.

            <Title>Temperature</Title>
            <Text>You are probably already familiar with temperature, and know that we use is it to describe how hot or cold an object is, but what, exactly is it? Temperature is not energy and it’s not heat. It is simply a number related to the average kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance; the greater the average kinetic energy, the greater the temperature. Notice that temperature is not equal to the kinetic energy, just proportional to it, and temperature readings do not tell you anything directly about the potential energy of the substance. 
Temperature can be measured in a variety of scales. When the temperature scale is measured up from the point where there is no molecular motion, it is known as an absolute scale, and is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the substance. The Kelvin and Rankine scales are absolute scales. We normally use the Fahrenheit or Celsius scales, which are offset from the corresponding absolute scale, and so are only indirectly related to the kinetic energy.

            <Text>Marine electric propulsion systems utilize generators to provide power for electric motors, which in turn drive the ship's propeller. The electric generators may be driven by any suitable prime mover, most commonly, diesel engines. While it may initially seem counterintuitive to interpose complex and costly equipment between the prime mover and the propeller when a simple line shaft and gearbox could transmit the power instead, there are valid justifications for the added complexity and expense.

1.2 Description
The Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG) is a system which is used to supply the stable and reliable electric power for Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) regardless of the generator’s terminal voltage and to supply at least 300% rated current to the generator during short circuit of the generator terminals, which occurs for 2 ~ 10 seconds.
The output AC voltage of PMG is increased proportionate to the speed. The output of it is connected to AVR’s input power terminals. The required field excitation power is supplied to the generator by the AVR.
A PMG has a strong magnetic field that could interfere with an implanted medical device, such as a pacemaker. Do not go near the PMG if the worker has and implanted medical device.
1.3 Construction
The PMG consists of stator and rotor part. The detailed components are shown in the below figure. The stator part having the 3 phase windings is bolted on the bearing housing of non drive-end side. The rotor part having the permanent magnets for magnetic field is bolted on the shaft end.

            <Title>Types of Head Protection</Title>
            <Text>There are several types of hard hats available, each designed for specific purposes and levels of protection. Here are some common types of hard hats:
   &lt;term&gt;Class A.&lt;/term&gt; Class A hard hats and caps are intended for general service and they provide protection against impact hazards and a limited protection against electrical shock. They are used in industries such as construction, manufacturing, mining, and shipbuilding. This is the most suitable hard hat for shipboard use. 


   &lt;term&gt;Class B.&lt;/term&gt; Class B hard hats are utility service hats which are designed to protect the wearer’s head from impact and penetration by falling or flying objects and from high-voltage shock and burns. They are used extensively by electrical workers. 

&lt;figure xml:id="hardhats_jpg"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Hard Hat&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image source="pics/ppe/hardhats.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

   &lt;term&gt;Class C.&lt;/term&gt; The safety hat or cap in Class C is designed specifically for lightweight comfort and impact protection and is sometimes known as a bump cap. Class C helmets are used on occasions where there is a possibility of bumping the head against a fixed object and no danger from falling objects or electrical shock. Bump caps can be worn for protection against scalp lacerations from contact with sharp objects. However, they are not substitutes for safety caps/hats because they do not afford protection from high impact forces or penetration by falling objects.

            <Text>Every day more than 1,000 eye injuries occur in American workplaces. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that three out of five workers who suffered eye injuries were not wearing eye protective equipment at the time of the accident, and when asked why, the victims often claimed that eye protection was not normally used in their type of work, or it was not required for the type of work performed at the time of the accident. Eye protection can save your sight, but you must be wearing it. 
Eye injuries can occur in many ways, but are primarily caused by rapidly flying objects. The BLS found that almost 70% of eye injuries were caused by flying or falling objects or sparks striking the eye. Most of these objects were smaller than a pin head, and were traveling faster than a hand-thrown object. Another 20% of eye injuries were caused by chemicals, and the remainder due to miscellaneous causes such as objects swinging into the eye, pulled into the eye or by light radiation.
Eye injuries can be prevented by wearing effective eye protection. To be effective, the eyewear must be of the appropriate type for the hazard encountered and properly fitted. The BLS survey found that 94% of the injuries to workers wearing eye protection were caused by objects or chemicals going around or under the protector. Goggles provide better protection than face shields or safety glasses, but the best protection is afforded when both goggles and a face shield are worn together.

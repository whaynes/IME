            <Title>Main steam stop valve</Title>
            <Text>No practical boiler could function without valves. Valves permit the operator to control fluid flow, and to isolate sections of the system for maintenance. There are dozens of valves used in the main steam cycle but in this discussion we will only mention a few of them. You may assume that valves are located throughout the system wherever they are necessary.

The main steam stop valve is located at the outlet of the superheater, and it is the primary valve used to connect or isolate the boiler from the remainder of the steam cycle. Specially designed valves are required for this service, because of the extreme differences of temperature encountered when cutting-in a boiler. Bypass lines are usually installed here to assist with warming up the main steam stop valve.

            <Title>Chemical Exposure</Title>
            <Text>You may be exposed to hazardous chemicals through inhalation, skin contact, or ingestion. Prolonged exposure or exposure to high concentrations can lead to adverse health effects such as respiratory issues, skin irritation, chemical burns, organ damage, or even long-term illnesses. 
You should be aware of the hazardous chemicals present in your workplace, handle them safely and take precautions to minimize exposure, such as using proper ventilation systems, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), and following established protocols.  
You can learn about the potential risks associated with a chemical, as well as instructions on how to handle and respond to accidents or exposures, in the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), which is required to be available in your workplace. MSDSs are typically created by the manufacturer or supplier of the chemical and are designed to ensure the safe use, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances.

            <Title>Types of Eye Protection</Title>
            <Text>The three main types of eye protection for general maintenance are safety glasses, goggles, and face shields. In addition, when welding, specialized equipment must be used to protect your eyes. Each method of eye protection has its own advantages and disadvantages.

**Safety Glasses.** Safety glasses are lightweight glasses that have shatter resistant lenses made of materials like polycarbonate or propionate plastic and often have side shields attached to the side pieces. Safety glasses are designed to stop flying objects such as chips, fragments, sand, and dirt from injuring your eyes. They also can provide laser light filtration to prevent reflections from the laser entering the eye and causing retinal burns. Safety glasses can be purchased with prescription lenses including bifocals if necessary.

The main advantage of safety glasses is that they are lightweight and relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The provide little to no protection from liquids or vapors, and some flying particles may get around the side shields.

**Goggles.** Goggles provide more complete protection of the eye than safety glasses, since they protect against both frontal and side impact. They come in two different types, vented and non-vented. Vented goggles are used to protect your eyes from splashes and flying objects, while Non-vented Goggles additionally protect your eyes from hazardous vapors, mists, and fumes.

**Face Shields.** Face shields are designed to augment other types of eye protection and are not meant to be a stand alone form of eye protection. Face shields are used to protect your entire face with goggles on under the shield to catch any liquids that might make it past the shield.</Text>

            <Title>Main Condenser</Title>
            <Text>The steam which expands in the low pressure turbine discharges to the *main condenser*, where it is cooled and condensed back to liquid condensate. The condenser is a shell-and-tube, surface-type, heat exchanger which uses seawater as the cooling medium, and normally operates at a low absolute pressure, or stated differently, at a high vacuum. The normal operating condition in the condenser shell is between 25 and 28.5 inches of Mercury vacuum, at the corresponding saturation temperature.

The main condenser serves three primary functions:

First, the condenser removes latent heat from the steam. Steam leaves the low pressure turbine and enters the condenser as a saturated vapor. As latent heat is removed, the steam condenses into droplets of water on the condenser tubes.

Second, the condenser recovers the condensate. The water droplets fall off the tubes and drain to the bottom of the condenser, where they collect in the *hotwell* at the bottom of the condenser and are pumped out and returned to the steam cycle.

Finally, the condenser acts as the heat sink in the steam cycle. The sink is the point where heat is removed from the cycle, and thermodynamically the condenser is just as important to the steam cycle as the boiler. A hydroelectric plant won’t work without an elevation difference between the top and bottom of the dam, and in the same way the steam cycle won’t work without a temperature difference between the boiler and condenser. The greater this temperature difference, the better: increased turbine output, greater plant efficiency, and reduced steam consumption are all benefits of lowering the condenser temperature. The lowest possible temperature in the condenser is achieved by using the coldest available cooling medium, which, in the case of a ship this is the surrounding seawater. Because of the fixed relationship between temperature and pressure of saturated steam, to operate the condenser at the lowest possible temperature, it must also be operated at the greatest possible vacuum.

The low pressure in the condenser permits it to be used for some secondary purposes as well. Fluids naturally flow from a high pressure region to a low pressure region without a pump, a method known as *vacuum drag*. Condensate from the *atmospheric drain tank* and the *air ejector condenser* is returned to the steam cycle by vacuum drag to the main condenser, and *make-up feed* water from the reserve feed tanks is added in the same way, as needed. Auxiliary exhaust steam, which is the exhaust from steam driven pumps, is normally used to heat feedwater in the DC heater. At times, there is more auxiliary exhaust steam produced than needed. This excess auxiliary exhaust may be discharged to the main condenser for recovery.</Text>

            <Title>Strainer</Title>
            <Text>A steam strainer is located in the steam line upstream of the main engine to prevent objects other than steam from entering the turbines, since solid objects impacting the turbine blades would quickly destroy them. Steam lines would normally be expected to be quite clean, but a strainer is cheap insurance against nuts, tools, and gloves left in the lines by shipyard workers, or rust flakes formed during a layup period. Unfortunately, water droplets due to wet steam or carryover will pass through the steam strainer.</Text>

            <Title>Condensation</Title>
            <Text>As stated previously, a large pressure drop across the turbine is required to get maximum energy extraction from the steam. The boiler supplies the high pressure at the inlet to the turbine, it is the job of the condenser to create a low pressure condition at the turbine outlet.

The condenser is a shell-and-tube heat exchanger cooled by seawater. It consists of a large, rectangular or cylindrical sealed shell containing thousands of tubes. A circulating pump forces cold seawater in at one end, through the tubes, and it exits overboard at the other end. Steam exiting from the turbine enters the condenser at the top, condenses on the tube surfaces and drains out the bottom. That is, the steam gives up its latent heat of condensation to the seawater, and returns to the liquid water state. Once the steam passes across the condenser tubes, it is no longer steam. It has condensed to liquid water, and from this point in the cycle is referred to as *condensate*. Condensate leaves the condenser as a low temperature, low pressure liquid.

Because the condensation is occurring at approximately the temperature of the seawater, the pressure in the condenser will be approximately equal to the saturation pressure of steam at this temperature, assuming that no air or other gases are present. For example, if the seawater temperature is 80 °F, the corresponding saturation pressure would be 0.5073 psia. This is a very high vacuum, and the greater the vacuum, the better the plant efficiency.

The latent heat removed from the steam by the seawater raises the temperature and increases the energy contained by the seawater, and this cooling water is discharged overboard.

It is unfortunate that some of the energy once contained by the fuel, and then passed on to the steam in the boiler, is eventually thrown away with the seawater. Wouldn’t it be better to somehow use this energy to power the ship? Absolutely, but there is nothing we can do about it! The only way to extract more energy from the steam is by having the turbine discharge to an even lower absolute pressure than we do. The only way to do that is to condense the steam at even lower temperatures than we are. But we can’t do that, because aboard ship there’s nothing colder than the surrounding ocean available to reject the heat to. If we decided not to reject any heat to the ocean at all, the pressure in the condenser would build up to the point where it would equal the steam pressure entering the turbine, and without a pressure drop, the steam would stop flowing altogether. There’s no win, but we’re doing the best we can.</Text>

            <Title>Heat</Title>
            <Text>*Heat* is a more familiar term than internal energy, but may actually be more difficult to define correctly. The important thing to remember is that heat is *thermal energy in transition* - that is, it is thermal energy that is moving from one substance or system to another.

An example will help to illustrate the difference between heat and internal energy. Suppose there are two equal lengths of pipe made of identical materials and containing steam at the same pressure and temperature. One pipe is well insulated; the other is not insulated at all. From everyday experience you know that more heat will flow from the uninsulated pipe than from the insulated pipe. When the two pipes are first filled with steam, the steam in one pipe contains exactly as much internal energy as the steam in the other pipe. We know this is true because the two pipes contain equal volumes of steam at the same pressure and at the same temperature. After a few minutes, the steam in the uninsulated pipe will contain much less internal energy than the steam in the insulated pipe, as we can tell by measuring the pressure and the temperature of the steam in each pipe. What has happened? Stored thermal energy - internal energy - has moved from one system to another, first from the steam to the pipe, then from the uninsulated pipe to the air. This movement or flow of thermal energy from one system to another is called heat.

A good deal of confusion exists concerning the use of the word “heat.” For example, you will hear people say that a hot object “contains” a lot of heat when they really mean that it contains a lot of internal energy. Or you will hear that heat is “added to” or “removed from” a substance. Since heat is the flow of thermal energy, it can no more be added to a substance than the flow of water could be added to a river. (You might add water, and this addition might increase the flow; but you could hardly say that you had added flow.) The only kind of thermal energy that can in any sense be added to or removed from a substance is internal energy. The distinction between heat and internal energy must be clear in your own mind before you can understand the basic principles of a steam plant. Remember, steam contains internal energy but it does not “contain heat.” Heat exists when the internal energy flows from the steam to something else (another substance or system).

###### Conduction. 

Conduction is the method by which heat flows from a hotter to a colder substance when there is physical contact between the two substances. For example, consider a cold metal bar which is held firmly against a piece of red-hot metal. In a short time, the end of the bar which is not touching the hotter metal will have become too hot to hold. We say that heat has been conducted from molecule to molecule, throughout the entire bar. The process of conduction will continue as long as there is a temperature difference between the two ends of the bar.

###### Radiation. 

Radiation is a mode of heat transfer that does not require any physical contact between the warmer substance and the cooler substance. For example, a person sitting near a hot stove is warmed by radiant heat even though the air between the person and the stove may remain cold. Similarly, radiant heat from the sun warms the earth without warming the space through which it passes.

###### Convection. 

At the molecular or sub-molecular level, heat transfer takes place through both the processes of conduction and radiation. If we use the term “heat transfer” in a somewhat different way, we may also include convection as a mode of heat transfer. However, it is important to understand the difference between convection and the basic heat transfer processes of conduction and radiation.

If we put a hot brick into a wheelbarrow and wheel it across the street, we have in one sense “transferred” heat. However, any heat transfer that takes place between the brick and its surroundings while we are wheeling it across the street will be by conduction and by radiation. Therefore, it would really be more accurate to say that we have “transported” the brick and all its contained thermal energy from one side of the street to the other.

Convection occurs only in fluids – liquids, gases, and vapors – not in solids, such as the brick we have just transported in the wheelbarrow. Convection is the transportation or movement of some portions of a fluid within the total mass of the fluid. As this movement occurs, the moving portions of the fluid transfer their contained thermal energy from one part of the fluid to another. The effect of convection is thus to mix the various portions of the fluid; the part that was at the bottom of the container may move to the top, or the part that was at one side may move to the other side. As this mixing takes place, heat transfer occurs from one part of the fluid to another and between the fluid and its surroundings. But this heat transfer, like any other heat transfer, takes place by conduction and by radiation. In other words, convection transports portions of the fluid; conduction and radiation transfer the thermal energy.

Convection serves a vital purpose in bringing the different parts of the fluid into close contact so that heat transfer can occur. Without convection, there can be little heat transfer from or within fluids. Most fluids are poor conductors of heat when they are not in motion.

What causes this transportation of a mass of fluid? In the case of *natural convection*, the movement is caused by differences in the density of different parts of the fluid. The differences in density are usually caused by unequal temperatures within the mass of fluid. For example, as the air over a hot radiator is heated, it becomes less dense and therefore begins to rise. Cooler, heavier air is drawn in to replace the heated air, and convection currents are thus setup. Another example of natural convection is the circulation of water in a natural circulation boiler. As the water in the generating tubes is heated, it expands and becomes much lighter (less dense) than the cooler water in the downcomers. Therefore the hotter and lighter water rises, while the cooler and heavier water flows downward. The resulting circulation of water in the boiler is thus clearly an example of convection currents established by differences in temperature (and therefore differences in density) in various parts of the fluid.

In the case of *forced convection*, some mechanical device such as a pump or a fan produces the movement of the fluid. When the main feed pump moves feedwater toward the boiler, the water is transported by forced convection. The flow of combustion gases through a boiler is partly by natural convection and partly by forced convection. Natural convection occurs because the gases of combustion are hotter and lighter than air, so they tend to rise and go up the stack. Forced convection is also involved in this process, however, because the forced draft blowers supply an air pressure which increases the rate at which the combustion gases travel across the tubes and up the stack. When you stir a cup of hot coffee, you are forcing convection and thus increasing the rate of heat transfer. Natural convection currents would be set up in the coffee if you did not stir it, because differences in density would occur as some portions of the coffee cooled before others. If you want to cool the coffee rapidly, use forced convection (stirring). If you do not want it to cool so rapidly, wait for natural convection to do the job.

In summary, then, we use the term convection to describe the transportation, or loosely, the “heat transfer” of a mass of fluid and its contained thermal energy. However, the processes by which any substance gains or loses thermal energy are most accurately described in terms of conduction and radiation.</Text>

            <Title>Types of Respirators</Title>
            <Text>OSHA divides respirators into two categories:

Fig: ppe/respirators1.jpg "Air-purifying respirator" class=right

**Air-purifying Respirators.** These units have filters, cartridges, or canisters that remove contaminants from the air by passing the air through the air-purifying element before it reaches the user. Air purifying respirators are further divided into:

-   *Particulate Respirators*, which capture particles such as dusts,     paint fumes, and mists, but do not protect against gases and vapors.     The filters in particulate respirators generally work better as     particles accumulate on the filter. If the filter becomes so clogged     that it is difficult to breathe, it should be replaced.

-   *Gas and Vapor Respirators*, which use a chemical cartridge or     canister to remove dangerous gases or vapors, but which do not     protect against airborne particles. These units only protect against     specific gases or vapors, and only provide protection as long as the     filter’s absorbing capacity remains.

-   *Combination Respirators*, which can be used in atmospheres that     contain both hazardous gases and particles.

Fig: ppe/respirators2.jpg "Atmosphere-supplying respirators" class=right

**Atmosphere-supplying Respirators.** These units supply clean air directly to the user from a source other than the air surrounding the user. The types of air-supplying respirators are:

-   *Air Supplied Respirators*, which have a hose which connects to a     source of clean air under pressure. These units have no time limit on the air supply, but the hose limits the range and mobility of the user and is susceptible to damage.

-   *Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus*, which have a wearable     clean-air supply pack. These units have better mobility than the air-supplied respirator, but the clean air time is limited to the     capacity of the tank.

-   *Combination Respirators*, which are similar to the air-supplied     respirators, but also have a small, self-contained air supply which     can be used for escape if the primary supply fails.

            <Title>Atmospheric Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere. At sea level the average pressure of the atmosphere is sufficient to support a column of mercury (Hg) 760.0 millimeters or 29.92 inches high. This is equivalent to a pressure of approximately 14.7 psi. This is known as the absolute pressure of the atmosphere, and is indicated by the unit *psia* (pounds per square inch, absolute)

A barometer is the device used to measure the pressure of the atmosphere, so the absolute pressure of the atmosphere is also known as the barometric pressure. When you hear a weather report, this is the value reported. The barometric pressure changes with weather conditions, but for most purposes aboard ship, this fact can be ignored, and we can assume that the atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia or 760 mm Hg. at all times. Notice, however, that the figure of 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute (psia.) represents the average atmospheric pressure at sea level, and does not always represent the actual pressure being exerted by the atmosphere at the moment that a gage is being read.</Text>

            <Title>Foot Protection</Title>
            <Text>Your feet are vulnerable to many potential hazards aboard ship. For example, slips and falls due to wet and slippery decks; heavy objects falling on or rolling over your foot because of the ship’s motion or accident; punctures caused by stepping on sharp objects; and potential electrical shock when your body is grounded through the soles of your shoes. In other industries, there are other hazards to consider, chemical exposure, high temperatures, molten metal splashes, static electricity, to name a few. Proper selection of footwear can minimize the danger of these hazards.

OSHA has established regulations for safety shoe design, including impact and compression strength requirements, and they have mandated footwear requirements for many industries. For example, safety shoes or boots with impact protection are required to be worn in work areas where carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection are required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual materials handling cars) or other activities in which materials or equipment could potentially roll over an employee’s feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection are required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a foot injury. Although there are no specific OSHA requirements for safety footwear for marine engineers, it is nonetheless sensible to select and wear safety shoes based on the hazards found in the engine room.</Text>

            <Title>The Steam Cycle</Title>
            <Text>There are two main methods used for propulsion of merchant ships today: steam turbines and diesel engines. Sail and steam reciprocating engines are long obsolete, and nuclear power, while used for some naval vessels, has been found to be impractical for merchant ships. Recently a few ships have been built with gas turbine propulsion, but it is not yet common.

Over the last 40 years, diesel propulsion has displaced steam propulsion as the dominant method of merchant ship propulsion, mainly because it has higher fuel efficiency, but also because it is easier to automate, requires less maintenance, and can be operated with smaller crews – all factors leading to operating cost reductions. Nevertheless, steam propulsion remains important, if for no other reason than it is the method we use aboard our training ship *Kennedy*. Also, steam power is used extensively in industry and power generation ashore, and the skills developed by a steam engineer aboard ship find high demand in the shoreside job market.

In this chapter we will discuss steam propulsion and the steam cycle. The steam cycle is the thermodynamic process which marine engineers use to transform the energy contained in the ship’s fuel oil or *bunkers* into the power to turn the ship’s propeller and supply all the other requirements necessary to move a steam ship from one point to another. We will begin with a discussion of a very simplified version of the steam cycle, which nevertheless illustrates all the important principles of its operation. Later, we will progress to a more detailed, practical, and efficient version of the cycle, which more closely represents the cycle used on other steam ships. The function of each of the components of the cycle will be briefly described here, and in more detail in later chapters. This cycle described here is not the only possibility, but it is representative, and it provides a good foundation for further study.</Text>

This LP turbine is equipped with eight Rateau pressure-compounded ahead stages, and two Curtis velocity-compounded stages for astern operation. During ahead operation steam from the crossover enters the after end of the low pressure turbine and flows aft to forward through the eight ahead stages before it exhausts down into the main condenser. During astern operation, the ahead throttle is closed and the astern throttle is opened. Steam is admitted to the steam ring (24) at the forward end of the LP turbine, and from there it flows aft through the two Curtis stages. When operating in the astern direction with normal steam conditions, the astern turbine can develop about 80% of the rated ahead torque at 50% of rated ahead speed.

            <Text>Always wear a welding helmet when arc welding. Your eyes, face, and neck need protection against the burning rays of the arc, and from the splatter of molten metal and slag. To protect your eyesight, make sure the welding helmet has a colored lens with at least a No. 10 shade when welding with 200 amperes or less. And never strike a welding arc before your helmet is in place. Never look at an arc from any distance with your naked eyes while someone else is welding.
Never chip slag when your eyes (or those of others nearby) are not protected by goggles, an eye shield, or the clear lens of a welding helmet. If fragments of hot slag were to hit the eye, medical attention would be required for their removal, and blindness could result. The risk of permanent eye injury is so great that you should never chip slag from a weld without protecting your eyes.</Text>

            <Text>
Fig: pumps/internal_gear.png "Internal Gear Pump" class=right

In an internal gear system, the teeth of one gear project outwards , but the teeth of the other gear project inwards toward the center of the gear as shown in Figref(internal_gear.png). One gear stands inside the other in the internal gear pump. A gear directly attached to the drive shaft of the pump is set off-center in a circular chamber fitted around its circumference with the spurs of an internal gear. The two gears mesh on one side of the pump chamber, between the suction and discharge. On the opposite side of the chamber a crescent shaped form (a stationary part of the pump) stands in the space between the two gears in such a way as to provide a close clearance with them.

The rotation of the central gear by the shaft causes the outside gear to rotate, since the two are in mesh. Everything in the chamber rotates except the crescent, causing the liquid to be trapped in the gear spaces as they pass the crescent. This liquid is carried from the suction to the discharge, where it is forced out of the pump by the remeshing of the gear teeth. As liquid is carried away from the suction side of the pump, the pressure is lowered and more liquid is drawn in.

The direction of flow through this type of pump can be reversed by rotating the crescent (and the pump cover it is attached to) 180 degrees.</Text>

            <Text>Globe valves Figref(GlobeValve.png) are used in throttling applications, that is, anytime you want to regulate or control the amount of liquid flowing through a system, you could select a globe valve. A bathroom sink faucet or a garden hose spigot are common examples of globe valves found around the house. In a globe valve, the moving part (called the *valve disk*) blocks an opening in the valve (called the *seat*) to shut off flow, and when the valve stem is turned, the disk moves away from the seat – in the path of the fluid flow – as the valve is opened. To close the globe valve, the disk is moved back towards the seat until they touch, seal, and stop the fluid flow through the valve.

            <Title>Air Ejector Condenser</Title>
            <Text>

  

The air ejector, as mentioned above, is a steam powered air pump which is used to remove air leakage from the condenser. Since the air ejector operates on steam, and normally draws out some steam along with the air it removes, it is important to recover this steam in a condenser so that it is not lost from the steam cycle.

We *could* use a saltwater cooled condenser to condense this steam, but we don’t. Instead the coolant used is the condensate from the main condenser on its way back to the boiler. This is done for two reasons. First, the heat given up by the condensing air ejector steam preheats the condensate before it returns to the boiler, thus saving energy. Any heat added before the condensate reaches the boiler represents fuel that doesn’t need to be burned. Second, by cooling the air ejector condenser with condensate, there is no chance of contaminating the condensate with saltwater in the event of a tube leak.

A typical air ejector condenser is shown in Figref(air_ejector.vw.png). The air ejector must operate in two stages to accomplish the necessary increase in pressure to move the air from the main condenser back to the atmosphere. As a result the condenser is also divided into two areas to maintain the pressure differential between the stages. The first condenser is known as the *inter-condenser*, and it discharges its condensate back to the main condenser. The second stage air ejector steam is condensed in the *after-condenser* and the condensate collected there is returned to the system by way of the *atmospheric drain tank*.

            <Text>**Safety Glasses.** Safety glasses are lightweight glasses that have shatter resistant lenses made of materials like polycarbonate or propionate plastic and often have side shields attached to the side pieces. Safety glasses are designed to stop flying objects such as chips, fragments, sand, and dirt from injuring your eyes. They also can provide laser light filtration to prevent reflections from the laser entering the eye and causing retinal burns. Safety glasses can be purchased with prescription lenses including bifocals if necessary.

The main advantage of safety glasses is that they are lightweight and relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The provide little to no protection from liquids or vapors, and some flying particles may get around the side shields.

            <Title>Operations[ops2]</Title>
            <Text>The following steps describe the procedure for safely starting a centrifugal pump.

**Centrifugal Pump Starting Procedure**

1.  Rotate the pump by hand to insure it is free to turn.

2.  If the pump has a packed shaft and is to operate with a high vacuum     on the suction side, open the seal water line to the stuffing box     (if fitted with a valve), and the suction vent line to remove vapors     from the suction casing. On a high speed boiler feed pump, open the     recirculating line.

3.  Open the suction valve and close the discharge valve.

Starting the centrifugal pump with the discharge valve closed allows  the pump to continuously operate at its shut-off head as it is  accelerating up to its normal operating speed. With the pump running  at its shut-off head, only a small amount of power is required to  turn the impeller. In turn, this greatly reduces the amount of power  required by the pump as it starts and accelerates up to running  speed. This is especially important when electric motors are used to  operate the pump. When an electric motor starts, it requires about  seven times the normal electrical current it uses when it is running  at its maximum horsepower just to get itself started. This extra  current required for starting drops off rapidly as the motor  approaches its normal running speed. For example, if an electric  motor requires 100 amps of current when it is running at its normal  designed maximum horsepower, it would require 500 to 700 amps to  start the motor. When an electric motor starts it is actually  operating in a severely overloaded condition. If we add the current  required to perform external work with the motor, its protective  devices may shut it down, it may severely overheat the electrical  wiring in the motor, or cause the wiring to burn up. Leaving the  discharge valve shut on the centrifugal pump when the motor is  started removes all the work load from the motor except for the  small frictional load created by the impeller churning through the  liquid trapped in the casing. 

4.  Prime or flood the pump casing with liquid.

5.  Start the pump prime mover.

6.  As the pump comes up to running speed, briefly open the casing vent     valve (if installed) to expel any air from the casing.

7.  When the pump is up to its normal running speed, open the discharge     valve.

8.  Check the suction and discharge pressure gages to insure the pump is     operating normally and make sure a packed pump shaft has a small     amount of liquid leakage.

9.  After the pump has run for a little while, check the casing,     stuffing box area (on a packed pump), and the bearing housings for     excessive temperatures.</Text>

            <Title>Maneuvering Valve</Title>
            <Text>The engine is manually controlled with the main throttles, which consists of an ahead valve, an astern valve, a steam strainer, and two overspeed trip sensing pistons. The maneuvering valve also includes a hydraulic mechanism to operate the ahead throttle valve and a jacking lever and counterweight which permits the ahead valve to be opened manually in the event of loss of oil pressure or other emergency. Steam entering the strainer body can be directed through either the ahead valve to the ahead elements of the HP turbine or through the astern valve to the astern elements of the LP turbine, depending on operating conditions.

The ahead valve is opened hydraulically. When the ahead handwheel is turned in the open direction, a pilot valve opens permitting control oil to act on a large operating piston. The piston moves downward against a spring and opens the ahead valve to admit steam to the ahead turbine. As the ahead valve opens, the pilot valve simultaneously closes shutting off the flow of oil to operating piston and stopping the motion of the ahead valve. This arrangement permits fine adjustments of the ahead valve with very little force by the throttle operator.

The astern valve is opened and closed mechanically simply by turning the astern handwheel. Steam must pass through an astern guarding valve in order to reach the astern elements.</Text>

            <Text>You are probably already familiar with temperature, and know that we use is it to describe how hot or cold an object is, but what, exactly is it? Temperature is not energy and it’s not heat. It is simply a number related to the average kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance; the greater the average kinetic energy, the greater the temperature. Notice that temperature is not equal to the kinetic energy, just proportional to it, and temperature readings do not tell you anything directly about the potential energy of the substance.

Temperature can be measured in a variety of scales. When the temperature scale is measured up from the point where there is no molecular motion, it is known as an absolute scale, and is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the substance. The Kelvin and Rankine scales are absolute scales. We normally use the Fahrenheit or Celsius scales, which are offset from the corresponding absolute scale, and so are only indirectly related to the kinetic energy.</Text>

            <Title>Types of Respirators</Title>
            <Text>OSHA divides respirators into two categories:

Fig: ppe/respirators1.jpg "Air-purifying respirator" class=right

**Air-purifying Respirators.** These units have filters, cartridges, or canisters that remove contaminants from the air by passing the air through the air-purifying element before it reaches the user. Air purifying respirators are further divided into:

-   *Particulate Respirators*, which capture particles such as dusts,     paint fumes, and mists, but do not protect against gases and vapors.     The filters in particulate respirators generally work better as     particles accumulate on the filter. If the filter becomes so clogged     that it is difficult to breathe, it should be replaced.

-   *Gas and Vapor Respirators*, which use a chemical cartridge or     canister to remove dangerous gases or vapors, but which do not     protect against airborne particles. These units only protect against     specific gases or vapors, and only provide protection as long as the     filter’s absorbing capacity remains.

-   *Combination Respirators*, which can be used in atmospheres that     contain both hazardous gases and particles.

Fig: ppe/respirators2.jpg "Atmosphere-supplying respirators" class=right

**Atmosphere-supplying Respirators.** These units supply clean air directly to the user from a source other than the air surrounding the user. The types of air-supplying respirators are:

-   *Air Supplied Respirators*, which have a hose which connects to a     source of clean air under pressure. These units have no time limit on the air supply, but the hose limits the range and mobility of the user and is susceptible to damage.

-   *Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus*, which have a wearable     clean-air supply pack. These units have better mobility than the air-supplied respirator, but the clean air time is limited to the     capacity of the tank.

-   *Combination Respirators*, which are similar to the air-supplied     respirators, but also have a small, self-contained air supply which     can be used for escape if the primary supply fails.

            <Title>Hearing Protection </Title>
            <Text>Over the years, many marine engineers have suffered permanent hearing loss due to hours of exposure to the high noise levels in the engine room. You can prevent the loss of your own hearing by using proper hearing protection such as earplugs and earmuffs religiously whenever you are exposed to loud noises.

Your ear is a delicate instrument which contains thousands of fine hair cells called cilia to detect sounds. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can injure or break these cells or even tear off groups of these cells. Since the hair cells don’t ever repair themselves, when enough of them are damaged, a hearing loss results.

Short, intense, sounds such as an explosion can cause immediate and permanent hearing loss, but most hearing loss occurs gradually due to prolonged exposure to high noise levels. Most of the time this loss is so gradual that you are not even aware that it is occurring. Hearing loss is progressive and will continue to get worse as you continue to expose yourself to a noisy environment, but if you can avoid further exposure, the hearing loss won’t get any worse.

Permanent hearing loss is not the only hazard associated with noisy environments. Tinnitus is a condition where a ringing or roaring sound is heard continuously in one or both ears. Tinnitus occurs when the hair cells are damaged in such a way that they produce sound signals to the brain even in the absence of actual stimulation. This noise is sometimes described as like having a cricket permanently stuck in your ear, and is very annoying.

Sound intensity is measured in units of *decibels* (dB). The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale in which 0 dB indicates the quietest sound that can be heard by a normal person. A quiet library is about 20 dB. A normal conversation occurs at a sound level of about 60 dB. A lawnmower produces about 85 dB, and at this level you should be wearing hearing protection. Sandblasting or a rock concert has a sound intensity of about 115 dB. At this level hearing damage can occur after only about 15 minutes of unprotected exposure.

According to OSHA regulations, when the 8 hour average noise exposure is above 85 dB, employers are required to institute a noise monitoring program, provide adequate hearing protectors, and ensure employees wear them. Continual, unprotected exposure to noises louder than 85 decibels for 8 hours or more can be dangerous, and may result in hearing loss.

You can easily tell if you should be wearing hearing protection. If you find yourself in a situation where it is too noisy to carry on a conversation at arms length, or if you notice that your ears ring or feel plugged for a time after leaving a noisy environment, you can be sure that you should have been wearing your hearing protection.</Text>

            <Title>Images</Title>
            <Text>There are three (four if you count just typing in raw LaTeX code) ways to handle images in Scrivener with MMD:

#

	1.	The first method is mostly devoid of any syntax. Without a caption you needn’t do anything special at all, but if you do want a caption, add it in double-quotes on the same line as the image, as shown. The image can be either linked or embedded in the file. Linking is a good way to ensure preservation of the image’s colour calibration, format, and meta-data.
	2.	This is probably the best method if you want to stick with using MMD syntax. Just type in the standard image syntax, and where you would put the name of the image, just Opt-drag it from the binder so that it makes a link instead of embedding it.
	3.	This is the non-mediated method. Scrivener will do nothing here, you are just establishing the absolute position of an image on your drive using the regular syntax. It’s a good method if you have lots of high-res graphics and don’t want to burden your project file with their bulk.
	4.	Hardly an “MMD” method at all, this is just passing through raw LaTeX by embedding it in an HTML comment.

In the first two methods, Scrivener will manage resources for you. It will collect images from within the text files, binder, or external linking locations, and gather copies of them all into a compile folder with everything relatively linked in the text file (so, looking like the LaTeX example).

Which to choose is largely up to taste, with only a few extreme factors weighting the advantage one way or another. For example, if you have a gigabyte of images in the book, you probably don’t want to have Scrivener collecting them all and creating copies every single time you compile—doing direct links with the third method will be the most efficient way to work.

Cross-referencing uses the alt attribute for the label. The alt attribute is set up in the square-bracketed bit of text. So in the third example, the cross-ref label is “externalimagelink”, but you can just use `[External image link][]` in your text. The same function that converts the alt text is used to convert the cross-ref text, so long as both are identical, they will reduce to the same underlying “externalimagelink”. When you use the first method, obviously there is nowhere to put the alt text, Scrivener will be doing that for you when you compile—it will just use the image name. So to cross reference to an automatically generated MMD image, you would type something like this, `...see [the chart][somechart.png] for more info.` Subsequently, I like to add a comment to the text with the graphic filename, so that I can easily find it later and know what to link to if I need to cross-ref it.

Incidentally, method #1 is what I use for the Scrivener manual, with a slight twist. The image is placed into the text stream and I cross-ref using its name, but when I actually create the .tex files, it adjust which image directory to use on the fly, based on the format and platform. So the Windows PDF gets Windows screenshots and the Mac PDF gets Mac screenshots all from the same project.

Scrivener’s links themselves are not meant to generate cross-references. If they had a public “face” that survived compile, then it would limit their usefulness to you as a writing tool.

With the new version of scrivener it preferable to use MMD syntax for bold / italic / footnotes within scrivener or use those features as built into scrivener and then integrate with compile?


I definitely prefer to use Scrivener’s footnotes rather than come up with ID numbers and type them all in by hand. There is no automatic function for converting bold and italics to syntax though, so you’ll need to stick with asterisks and such. The main reason for the lack of an auto feature is that it is difficult to correct for the inherent sloppiness of RTF style formatting. Because whitespaces can be formatted accidentally (and rather easily), you’d end up with * stuff* like that which doesn’t render very well with MMD.</Text>

            <Title>Reciprocating Pumps</Title>
            <Text>In reciprocating pumps, a power source drives a piston or plunger back and forth in a cylinder. This action pushes liquid out into the discharge on the discharge stroke, and draws liquid into the cylinder, from the source of supply, on the suction stroke. For each stroke, the same quantity of liquid enters and leaves the cylinder. The fluid flow through the pump is controlled by two check valves, one in the suction line and the other in the discharge line of the pump.

Figref(recip_pump.png) shows a steam driven reciprocating pump. The steam piston (7) is driven up and down by steam, delivering power to the liquid piston, or *plunger* (69), which pumps the liquid. When the liquid piston (69) is moved down, the area above the piston is on a suction stroke. As the piston moves down in cylinder (72), the increase in cylinder volume causes a decrease in cylinder pressure. When the pressure in the cylinder drops below atmospheric pressure (creating a vacuum in the cylinder), the atmospheric pressure on the liquid in the suction tank forces the liquid up the suction pipe, through suction valve (85) and into the cylinder. Atmospheric pressure plus the liquid pressure in the discharge pipe create a pressure higher than the pressure in the cylinder. This holds the discharge valve (84) closed. When the piston begins to move up on the discharge stroke, a decrease in cylinder volume occurs, attempting to compress the liquid. This results in an increase in liquid pressure in the cylinder. As soon as the cylinder pressure exceeds the pressure in the suction pipe, the suction valve (85) is forced closed. As the piston continues to move up, the liquid pressure in the cylinder continues to rise. When the liquid pressure in the cylinder exceeds the pressure in the discharge pipe, the discharge valve (84) opens and fluid flows from the cylinder into the discharge line. This process repeated many times can build up a considerable discharge head (pressure) on the discharge side of the pump.

From terminology already covered, reciprocating pumps are classified as positive displacement, self-priming and most are constant delivery, except for some specialized hydraulic pumps.</Text>

            <Text>A confined space is defined by OSHA as a space that has limited or restricted means of entry, is not designed for continuous occupancy, and is large enough and configured so that a person can enter the space and maneuver well enough to perform tasks.  
Confined spaces pose several hazards that can endanger workers who enter  them due to their limited entry and exit points, restricted airflow, and potential for hazardous atmospheres. 
On ships, some examples of confined spaces include:  Cargo and fuel tanks, cofferdams, pressure vessels, sewage tanks, and void spaces. 
Here are some hazards associated with confined spaces:</Text>

            <Title>Force</Title>
            <Text>What is force? In simple terms, a force is a push or a pull. More precisely, a force is a vector quantity which tends to produce an acceleration of a body in the direction of its application. This means that if you want a stationary object to move, you must apply a force to it to get it going. If you want to keep it moving, you need to continuously apply a force to it to overcome friction, which is itself a force. Forces can exist without motion too – when an object is stationary it’s usually because there are many forces acting on it which cancel each other out, leaving no net force acting on the object. Forces always occur in pairs. A push on an object is always accompanied by an equal and opposite force acting on the pusher.
In the English system of units, force is measured in pounds, tons, or long tons. In the SI system, force is measured in newtons (N) or kilonewtons (kN). For estimation purposes, a newton is about a quarter of a pound.
One important force which we experience every day is weight. Weight is the force of gravity - the attraction between an object and the earth. The weight force exerted on an object is proportional to the mass of the object according to Newton's second law, which states: &lt;me&gt;W = mg&lt;/me&gt; where W is the weight, m is the mass, and g is the gravitational constant.
The constant *g* depends on where you are: on earth the constant is greater than it is on the moon, so you weigh less on the moon than you do on earth. In outer space, the constant is zero, making you weightless there. Be careful not to confuse weight with mass. The mass of an object will not change when it moves to another location, but its weight may. One reason why people often confuse weight with mass is because in the English system and on the surface of the earth, the gravitational constant *g* is equal to 1, and so one pound of mass has a weight of one pound of force. Move to the moon, and the pound of mass now weighs about six tenths of a pound. On earth in the SI system, *g* is approximately equal to 9.81 \\(\textrm{m/s}^2\\).</Text>

            <Title>Turbine Construction</Title>
            <Text>The propulsion turbines aboard a steam powered merchant vessel typically consists of two units, a high-pressure (HP) turbine, and a low-pressure (LP) turbine, arranged side by side. The outlet of the high pressure turbine is connected directly to the inlet of the low pressure turbine through a pipe called the *steam crossover*. This is known as a *cross-compound* arrangement, and it is selected because it is compact and easier to manufacture and install than a longer single turbine. Another advantage of cross compounding is that each turbine can operate at the speed that best matches its inlet steam conditions, improving its efficiency. The LP turbine runs at about half the speed of the HP turbine. Because turbines are most efficient at high speeds and propellers are most efficient at low speeds, a two stage, or *double-reduction* gear is used to connect the turbines to the propeller, allowing each to operate at its optimum speed.

In a cross-compound turbine, the total available energy in the steam is divided about equally between the two turbines when they are operating at full load, so that each performs nearly the same amount of work. The division of each turbine into stages further subdivides the total pressure and velocity of the steam into consecutively lower increments from stage to stage. Larger nozzle areas and larger blades are required with each subsequent stage because the specific volume of the steam increases as its pressure decreases.

The turbines once installed on the MMA training vessel *Patriot State* will be used to illustrate some interesting construction features of marine propulsion turbines. These turbines were manufactured by General Electric and were designed to produce 18,000 shaft horsepower at 115 shaft rpm with the HP turbine at 6442 rpm and the LP turbine operating at 3256 rpm, under normal steam conditions. The HP turbine was removed from the vessel, and you can inspect it in the MMA turbine lab in the Storer Building.</Text>

            <Title>Sensible Heat and Latent Heat</Title>
            <Text>The terms *sensible heat* and *latent heat* are often used to indicate the effect that the flow of heat has on a substance. The flow of heat from one substance to another is normally reflected in a temperature change in each substance-the hotter substance becomes cooler; the cooler substance becomes hotter. However, the flow of heat is not reflected in a temperature change in a substance that is in the process of changing from one physical state (solid, liquid, or gas) to another. When the flow of heat is reflected in a temperature change, we say that sensible heat has been added to or removed from the substance. When the flow of heat is not reflected in a temperature change but is reflected in the changing physical state of a substance, we say that latent heat has been added or removed.

Does anything bother you in this last paragraph? It should. Here we are, talking about adding and removing heat. And, furthermore, we are talking about sensible heat and latent heat as though we had two different kinds of heat to consider. As noted before, this is common (if inaccurate) engineering language. So keep the following points clear in your mind: (1) heat is the flow of thermal energy; (2) when we talk about adding and removing heat, we mean that we are providing temperature differentials so that thermal energy can flow from one substance to another; and (3) when we talk about sensible heat and latent heat, we are talking about two different kinds of effects that can be produced by heat, but not about two different kinds of heat.

The three basic physical states of all matter are *solid,* *liquid,* and *gas* (or vapor). The physical state of a substance is closely related to the distance between molecules. The molecules are closest together in solids, farther apart in liquids, and farthest apart in gases. When the flow of heat to a substance is not reflected in a temperature change, we know that the energy is being used to increase the distance between the molecules of the substance and thus to change it from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. Such a change is known as a *phase change*. You might say that latent heat is the energy price that must be paid for a change of state from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. The energy is not lost; rather, it is stored in the substance as internal energy. The energy price is “repaid,” so to speak, when the substance changes back from gas to liquid or from liquid to solid. 

Fig: thermo/LatentHeat.png "Phase Changes" class=right width=350px

Figref(LatentHeat.png) shows the relationship between sensible heat and latent heat for one substance, water, at atmospheric pressure. The same kind of chart could be drawn up for other substances; however, different amounts of thermal energy would of course be required for each change of temperature and for each change of physical state.

If we start with 1 pound of ice at 0 °F, we must add 16 BTU in order to raise the temperature of the ice to 32 °F. We call this adding sensible heat. To change the pound of ice at 32 °F to a pound of water at 32 °F, we must add 144 BTU (the *latent heat of fusion*). There will be no change in temperature while the ice is melting. After all the ice has melted, however, the temperature of the water will be raised as additional heat is supplied. If we add 180 BTU that is, 1 BTU for each degree of temperature between 32 °F and 212 °F the temperature of the water will be raised to the boiling point. To change the pound of water at 212 °F, to a pound of steam at 212 °F, we must add 970 BTU (the *latent heat of vaporization*). After all the water has been converted to steam, the addition of more heat will cause an increase in the temperature of the steam. If we add approximately 42 BTU to the pound of steam which is at 212 °F, we can superheat it to 300 °F.

The same relationships apply when heat is being removed. The removal of 42 BTU from the pound of steam which is at 300 °F will cause the temperature to drop to 212 °F. As the pound of steam at 212 °F changes to a pound of water at 212 °F, 970 BTU are given off. When a substance is changing from a gas or vapor to a liquid, we usually use the term *latent heat of condensation* for the heat that is given off. Notice, however, that the latent heat of condensation is exactly the same as the latent heat of vaporization. Only the terms differ to indicate whether a substance is being changed into a liquid or into a gas. The removal of another 180 BTU of sensible heat will lower the temperature of the pound of water from 212 °F to 32 °F. As the pound of water at 32 °F changes to a pound of ice at 32 °F 144 BTU are given off without any accompanying change of temperature. Further removal of heat causes the temperature of the ice to decrease.</Text>

            <Title>Convection</Title>
            <Text>At the molecular or sub-molecular level, heat transfer takes place through both the processes of conduction and radiation. If we use the term “heat transfer” in a somewhat different way, we may also include convection as a mode of heat transfer. However, it is important to understand the difference between convection and the basic heat transfer processes of conduction and radiation.

If we put a hot brick into a wheelbarrow and wheel it across the street, we have in one sense “transferred” heat. However, any heat transfer that takes place between the brick and its surroundings while we are wheeling it across the street will be by conduction and by radiation. Therefore, it would really be more accurate to say that we have “transported” the brick and all its contained thermal energy from one side of the street to the other.

Convection occurs only in fluids – liquids, gases, and vapors – not in solids, such as the brick we have just transported in the wheelbarrow. Convection is the transportation or movement of some portions of a fluid within the total mass of the fluid. As this movement occurs, the moving portions of the fluid transfer their contained thermal energy from one part of the fluid to another. The effect of convection is thus to mix the various portions of the fluid; the part that was at the bottom of the container may move to the top, or the part that was at one side may move to the other side. As this mixing takes place, heat transfer occurs from one part of the fluid to another and between the fluid and its surroundings. But this heat transfer, like any other heat transfer, takes place by conduction and by radiation. In other words, convection transports portions of the fluid; conduction and radiation transfer the thermal energy.

Convection serves a vital purpose in bringing the different parts of the fluid into close contact so that heat transfer can occur. Without convection, there can be little heat transfer from or within fluids. Most fluids are poor conductors of heat when they are not in motion.

What causes this transportation of a mass of fluid? In the case of *natural convection*, the movement is caused by differences in the density of different parts of the fluid. The differences in density are usually caused by unequal temperatures within the mass of fluid. For example, as the air over a hot radiator is heated, it becomes less dense and therefore begins to rise. Cooler, heavier air is drawn in to replace the heated air, and convection currents are thus setup. Another example of natural convection is the circulation of water in a natural circulation boiler. As the water in the generating tubes is heated, it expands and becomes much lighter (less dense) than the cooler water in the downcomers. Therefore the hotter and lighter water rises, while the cooler and heavier water flows downward. The resulting circulation of water in the boiler is thus clearly an example of convection currents established by differences in temperature (and therefore differences in density) in various parts of the fluid.

In the case of *forced convection*, some mechanical device such as a pump or a fan produces the movement of the fluid. When the main feed pump moves feedwater toward the boiler, the water is transported by forced convection. The flow of combustion gases through a boiler is partly by natural convection and partly by forced convection. Natural convection occurs because the gases of combustion are hotter and lighter than air, so they tend to rise and go up the stack. Forced convection is also involved in this process, however, because the forced draft blowers supply an air pressure which increases the rate at which the combustion gases travel across the tubes and up the stack. When you stir a cup of hot coffee, you are forcing convection and thus increasing the rate of heat transfer. Natural convection currents would be set up in the coffee if you did not stir it, because differences in density would occur as some portions of the coffee cooled before others. If you want to cool the coffee rapidly, use forced convection (stirring). If you do not want it to cool so rapidly, wait for natural convection to do the job.

In summary, then, we use the term convection to describe the transportation, or loosely, the “heat transfer” of a mass of fluid and its contained thermal energy. However, the processes by which any substance gains or loses thermal energy are most accurately described in terms of conduction and radiation.</Text>

            <Text>The IMO has developed guidelines for rest requirements to address the issue of fatigue among seafarers. These guidelines are outlined in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention). 
The STCW Convention sets out minimum hours of rest for seafarers. The standard requires that seafarers receive a minimum of 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period and a minimum of 77 hours of rest in any 7-day period. The hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, with one period being at least 6 hours in length.
In situations where the safety of the ship, crew, or passengers is compromised, and in cases of emergencies or drills, the rest period may be temporarily shortened or interrupted. However, the seafarers should be provided with compensatory rest as soon as possible.

            <Title>Respiratory Protection</Title>
            <Text>A respirator is a face piece, hood, or helmet that is designed to protect the user from a variety of harmful airborne agents. Respirators can protect you from dust and particulates in the air, hazardous vapors, oxygen deficiency, or a combination of these. Respirators are not necessary for routine operations in the engine room, but may be advisable during certain maintenance procedures such as chipping and painting.

OSHA regulations require that respirators shall be used in the following circumstances:

-   Where exposure levels exceed the *permissible exposure limit* (PEL),     during the time period necessary to install or implement feasible     engineering and work practice controls;
-   In those maintenance and repair activities and during those brief or     intermittent operations where exposures exceed the PEL and     engineering and work practice controls are not feasible or are not     required;
-   In regulated areas;
-   Where the employer has implemented all feasible engineering and work     practice controls and such controls are not sufficient to reduce     exposures to or below the PEL; and,
-   In emergencies.

Before using a respirator you should be thoroughly trained in its use. Some of the areas that you should be familiar with include: respiratory hazards; respirator selection criteria, limitations, adjustment, fit, cleaning, and storage procedures, etc. The selection of a suitable respirator depends on the hazard to which you are exposed, and the correct respirator cannot be selected without a thorough understanding of the hazard.</Text>

The steam is then redirected by a row of fixed blades back into the following row of moving blades. The process continues through additional rows of moving and fixed blades until the nearly all the steam energy is extracted. As a practical matter, Curtis stages usually have two rows of moving blades, and rarely have more than three, because the efficiency improvements for each additional row do not justify the additional cost. The pressure and velocity relation for a Curtis stage is shown in Figref(curtis.png). In this design, maximum power is developed when the blade speed is one quarter of the steam speed.

            <Title>LP Turbine</Title>
            <Text>The L.P. turbine follows the H.P. turbine and continues to extract energy from the steam. The steam enters at a low pressure (a vacuum actually, at low loads) and exits at an even lower pressure into the main condenser. The specific volume of steam at these low pressures is large, which means that the turbine blades and the L.P. turbine itself are also large. When looking at the two turbines, it is always easy to identify the L.P. turbine because of its size; eight to ten feet in diameter is not unusual.

Steam leaves the L.P. turbine as saturated steam, so you can determine the steam temperature by looking up the saturation temperature for the condenser pressure in the steam tables. For example, if the condenser pressure is 28.9 in Hg vacuum, this corresponds to an absolute pressure of 0.5 psia, and this has a saturation temperature of about 80 °F. Are you surprised? Steam isn’t always hot... it depends on the pressure.

The forward end of the L.P. Turbine rotor contains the *Astern Elements*. These are two or three rows of blades designed to rotate the shaft in the astern direction. Since there are so few rows of astern blades, the power the turbine is capable of producing in the astern direction is limited.</Text>

            <Title>Burners</Title>
            <Text>Several fuel oil burners are located on the front of the boiler to deliver fuel and air to the boiler furnace in the proper mixture to obtain optimum combustion. The burner assembly, Figref(register.png), consists of two main parts, the *fuel oil atomizer* assembly, which breaks up the fuel oil into a fine mist and sprays it into the furnace, and the *air register* assembly, which directs the air flow into the furnace to insure good air/fuel mixture for complete combustion. The burner may also include a peephole or a flame scanner to monitor the status of the flame, a torch hole for lighting the flame, and/or an igniter so that the burner can be lit off automatically as required by the combustion control system. 

Fig: boilers/register.png "Burner Assembly"

Fig: boilers/atomizer.png "Atomizer"

A cross sectional view of a *steam atomizer* is shown in Figref(atomizer.png) In this design, steam under pressure is used to force fuel through the *sprayer plate* and *orifice* and into the furnace as small droplets with high velocity which ignite easily and mix thoroughly with the surrounding air. The fuel forms a cone-shaped spray of oil which extends far into the furnace. Steam atomizers are capable of providing good atomization at all steaming rates, however the steam used for atomization is lost from the steam cycle and must be replaced with make-up feed.

When steam is not available for atomization, such as when lighting off a dead ship, a steam assist atomizer can not be used. Under these circumstances, a *straight mechanical* atomizer is used instead. In this design, fuel pressure alone atomizes the fuel into tiny particles. The quality of the atomization depends on the fuel pressure, so this design is not particularly suitable for use when the boiler load and fuel pressure are varying frequently, as it requires the operator to frequently change sprayer plates to compensate for varying fuel pressures.

The register assembly consists of three main parts. The *movable air doors* allow the operator to open and close the register. The doors are opened wide when the register is in service, and closed when it is not being used. The *diffuser plate* helps the air to mix evenly with the oil and it prevents the flame from being blown back behind the atomizer. The *stationary air foils* guide the majority of the air, giving it a swirling motion and directing it toward the oil cone beyond the diffuser.

The air and gas flow paths through the boiler are shown in Figref(boilergasflow.png). Air supplied by the forced draft fan passes across the tubes of a steam heated air heater, and then through the boiler casing where it picks up more heat. The air passes through the register and into the furnace, where it meets up with fuel sprayed by the atomizer. It immediately ignites, and the burner flame liberates heat energy from the fuel to heat the water in the boiler. Some of this heat is in the form of thermal radiation which shines on the exposed screen and wall tubes. Other energy resides in the thermal energy of the combustion gases. These hot combustion gases flow from the furnace through the screen tubes, past the superheater tubes and the main generating bank and finally across the economizer tubes, losing heat and dropping in temperature along the way. Finally, the hot combustion gases pass up the smokestack to the atmosphere.</Text>

            <Title>Lighting Off</Title>
            <Text>The process of igniting the flame in the boiler is called *lighting off*. This is a critical operation because following incorrect procedures can lead to a furnace explosion. A boiler is lit off manually with a flaming torch, or with an automatic igniter.

To prevent a boiler explosion, there must be no unburned fuel or fuel vapors in the furnace when the torch is inserted. We insure this by properly *purging* the furnace prior to lighting off. To purge, open all register air doors and run the forced draft fans on High Speed for at least five minutes. Only after a good purge is it safe to insert the torch, turn on the fuel supply, and light off the burner. Once one burner is lit off, adjoining burners can easily be lit from the flame of the first. Automated systems follow the same procedure automatically, but use an igniter instead of a torch.</Text>

            <Title>Expansion</Title>
            <Text>The thermal energy added to the working fluid in the generation stage is converted to mechanical energy, or work, in the expansion stage. This work is produced in the form of a rotating turbine shaft which drives the propeller and moves the ship through the water. The more energy we can remove at this stage, the higher the efficiency of the steam cycle. Unfortunately, it is not possible to remove all the energy from the steam in the turbine. Some energy remains in the steam and is carried to the next stage of the cycle.

A *turbine* is the device used to accomplish the energy transformation in the expansion stage. Like a pinwheel or a fan, a turbine has a freely rotating shaft with many carefully designed*turbine blades* attached. However, unlike a fan, the turbine rotor is completely enclosed in a casing which also contains *nozzles* and *stationary blades* designed to direct the steam towards the rotating blades.

High-pressure, high-temperature steam passes through the nozzle, which has a very small opening, and it emerges with a high velocity. The thermal energy of the steam is converted into mechanical kinetic energy in the nozzle. This high velocity steam jet hits the blades and imparts a turning torque to the rotor shaft and converts its kinetic energy to rotational kinetic energy of the shaft. Most turbines have several rows of blades, forming multiple stages to extract the maximum energy from the steam. As the steam gives up its thermal energy, its temperature and pressure both drop. The steam leaves the turbine at a low temperature and low pressure.

High steam pressure at the inlet to the turbine is important for energy conversion, but it is equally important to have a low pressure at the turbine outlet. Steam, or any fluid for that matter, will only flow from high pressure to lower pressure. Without a pressure drop across the blades of the turbine, there would be no steam flow, and no energy conversion. To maximize the energy conversion, we must also maximize the pressure drop across the turbine.</Text>

Most screw type pumps consists of two to four intermeshing screws rotating in a closely fitted chamber. Liquid, trapped in the channels between the intermeshing screws, is pushed to the pump discharge as the thread of one screw rotates onto the channel of another screw. One screw, generally called the *power rotor*, is driven by an outside power source. The other screws, generally called *idler rotors*, have their shafts turned by timing gears or by direct contact between the intermeshing screw threads.</Text>

            <Title>Recovery</Title>
            <Text>The only thing that remains to complete the cycle is to return the condensate to the boiler to be heated up again. Unfortunately, the condensate leaving the condenser is at a low pressure and the boiler operates at a much higher pressure. Condensate won’t flow back into the boiler by itself. A pump is required to raise the pressure and return the condensate to the boiler.

The pump, known as the *feed pump*, draws condensate from the condenser discharge, raises its pressure slightly above the boiler pressure, and discharges it back into the boiler to restart the cycle. Condensate leaving the feed pump is known as *feedwater*.

Work is required to drive the feed pump, and this energy reduces the net work produced by the cycle and available to turn the shaft. Fortunately, since water is incompressible it takes much less work to raise its pressure back to the boiler pressure than we get from an equivalent pressure drop across the turbine, and so there is a net positive amount of work produced by the cycle.</Text>

**Disposable foam plugs.** Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each person’s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better.

**Reusable, pre-molded plugs.** Pre-molded plugs are made from silicone, plastic or rubber and are manufactured as either “one-size-fits-most” or are available in several sizes. Be sure to choose the proper size for your ear canals. In some cases, different size plugs may be required for each ear. The advantage of pre-molded plugs are that they are inexpensive, reusable, washable, convenient to carry, and come in a variety of sizes. Nearly everyone can find a plug that will be comfortable and effective. Another advantage is that in a dirty environment like the engine room, you don’t need to handle or roll the tips. You insert this type of plug by reaching over your head with one hand to pull up on your ear. Then use your other hand to insert the plug with a gentle rocking motion until you have sealed the ear canal.

**Hearing Bands.** Hearing Bands, also called canal caps or semi-insert devices often resemble earplugs on a flexible plastic or metal band. The earplug tips of a canal cap may be a formable or pre-molded material. Some have headbands that can be worn over the head, behind the neck or under the chin. The main advantage of canal caps is their convenience They are easy to put on and take off . When it’s quiet, employees can leave the band hanging around their necks, but they can quickly insert the plug tips when hazardous noise starts again. These devices are ideal for intermittent use, but they provide less protection then either plugs or muffs. Some people find the pressure from the bands uncomfortable.

&gt;**What is a Decibel?**

&gt;The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first let’s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power *P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*, and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power *P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*, but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* dB where the log is to base 10. If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 2 = 3 dB. If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 10 = 10 dB. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 1,000,000 = 60 dB. This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size.

&gt;Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, *p*. The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of *x* is just 2 log *x*, this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with *p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*and *p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* is defined as: 20 log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) dB where the log is to base 10. This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. (This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers (Walkmans) are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries.) So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that 20 log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) = 86 dB where *p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;* is the sound pressure of the reference level, and *p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) = 4.3 dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long.

&gt;What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level = 20 log (*p*&lt;sub&gt;measured&lt;/sub&gt; /*p*&lt;sub&gt;reference&lt;/sub&gt; ) = 20 log 1 = 0 dB. So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals.</Text>

            <Text>While the temperature of the incoming seawater is not under our control, the cooling water outlet temperature is a good indicator of condenser operation. The important parameter is the temperature rise of the circulating water across the condenser, which should normally be about 10 degrees F. A larger temperature rise indicates insufficient cooling water flow or loss of vacuum, while a smaller temperature rise indicates energy wasted by pumping too much water.

The condensate temperature should also be noted. Ideally, the condensate should leave the condenser at or slightly above the saturation temperature corresponding to the absolute pressure in the condenser. When it is cooled below saturation, the difference between the actual temperature of the condensate and the corresponding saturation temperature is called *condensate depression* and the condensate is said to be *subcooled*. Condensate depression is undesirable because additional heat energy will be required to reheat the condensate before it can be boiled again. Proper design of the steam lanes and avoiding excess cooling water should minimize condensate depression.</Text>

            <Title>Conservation of Energy</Title>
            <Text>The basic principle dealing with the transformation of energy is the *Principle of Conservation of Energy*. This principle can be stated in several ways. Most commonly, perhaps, it is stated: “Energy can be neither destroyed nor created, but only transformed.” Another way to state this principle is: “The total quantity of energy in the universe is always the same.” Still another way of expressing this principle is by the equation

\\[\mathrm{Energy}_{in} = \mathrm{Energy}_{out}\\]

The “energy out” may be quite different in form from the “energy in,” but the total amount of energy input must always equal the total amount of energy output.

Another principle, the *Principle of Conservation of Matter,* states: “Matter can be neither created nor destroyed, but only transformed.” As you probably know, the development of the atomic bomb demonstrated that matter can be converted into energy; other developments have demonstrated that energy can be converted into matter. Therefore, the Principle of the Conservation of Energy and the Principle of the Conservation of Matter are no longer considered as two parts of a single law or principle but are combined into one principle: “Matter and energy are interchangeable, and the total amount of energy and matter in the universe is constant."

The interchangeability of matter and energy is mentioned here only to point out that the statement “energy in must equal energy out” is not strictly true for certain situations. However, any noticeable conversion of matter into energy or energy into matter can occur only under very special conditions that we need not consider now. All the energy transformations that we will deal with can be understood quite simply if we consider only the Principle of the Conservation of Energy, that is, *Energy in must equal Energy out*.</Text>

            <Title>Water level</Title>
            <Text>Maintaining proper boiler water level in the steam drum is probably the most critical aspect of boiler operation. *High Water* is harmful because it reduces the efficiency of the steam separators. More importantly, excessively high water will enter the dry pipe, pass through the superheater and enter the turbine – a condition known as *carryover*. Carryover leads to dangerous *water hammer* in the steam lines, scaling in the superheater, and will damage to turbine rotors and thrust bearings. *Low Water* is perhaps even more harmful than high water. It the boiler water level falls too low, portions of the generating tubes will be uncovered and the furnace temperature will quickly overheat and weaken the boiler tubes, leading to catastrophic boiler damage, steam escape, and personnel injury.

The boiler is equipped with several means to observe the boiler water level. The simplest is the *boiler gage glass*. This device is mounted on the steam drum and makes the water level in the drum directly visible in the same way that the glass on the side of a coffee urn works. The glass is mounted such that the normal operating level is in the center of the glass, and as long as the water level is visible in the glass, the boiler is safe, however the operator should never let the level get within two inches of the top or bottom of the gage glass. A visible water level in the gage glass is reassuring, but it may be a false level if the gage glass valves are closed or the lines are blocked. Periodically blowing down the gage glass will insure that it indicates accurately. The *remote level indicator*, Figref(waterlevel.png), is a water level sensor connected to a level display that can be mounted in any location, normally wherever convenient for the boiler operator. This device is also called the *eye-hi* indicator. *High and Low Level Alarms* are sensors which are used to trigger an alarm when the water reaches a critical level. Usually two sensors are provided, the first gives a warning signal when the level is about six inches above or below the normal water level, the second secures the fires if the level continues to rise or fall after the warning alarm.

&gt;**Important:** 

&gt;The boiler water level must be visible in the gage glass at all times. Any time the water level is not visible, either high or low, the boiler fires must be secured *immediately*.

The feed water regulator system is designed to monitor and maintain the water level in the boiler automatically under all normal loads and operating conditions. The main feed pump takes a suction from the DC Heater, and discharges through the feedwater regulating valve, then into the economizer and the steam drum. The feedwater regulator contains a *drum level sensor* which opens or closes the regulating valve in response to the drum water level. When the water level goes up, the regulating valve closes off to restrict the feed water to the drum and bring the level down, and vice versa. This drum level sensing regulator uses *feedback control*, which means that is has a fairly slow response; the drum level must deviate from normal before the regulator can make a correction. To improve the regulator response, most feedwater regulator systems also include a steam flow sensor, which gives the regulator a predictive ability known as *feedforward control*. As soon as the sensor detects a change in the steam flow, it can respond immediately with a corresponding change in the feedwater flow rate. Feedwater regulators containing both drum level and steam flow sensors are known as *two-element* feedwater regulators.

The feed water regulator system uses compressed air from the *combustion control air system* to actuate the feed water regulator valve and power the regulator. The watch engineer must carefully watch the control air system pressure, because problems there will quickly lead to problems with the boiler water level. If the control air compressor fails, one response would be to cross connect the *ship’s service air* into the system. Complete loss of compressed air will cause the feedwater regulator valve to open wide. The operator then must adjust the feed water check valve manually to regulate the boiler drum level.

The discharge pressure of the feed pump plays a critical role in the proper operation of the feedwater regulator system. Naturally, the feed pump discharge pressure must be greater than the steam drum pressure at all times, or the feed water will not be able to flow into the boiler. Also, if the feed pump discharge pressure fluctuates, the regulator system will have a difficult time responding properly, so the feed pump is equipped with a *constant pressure governor* which maintains a steady discharge pressure at all times, or an *excess pressure governor*, which maintains a fixed pressure differential above the drum pressure. The watch engineer should keep a close eye on the feed pump discharge pressure, because changes here will quickly lead to problems with the steam drum level. A stand-by feed pump should always be maintained ready to start quickly if the operating pump has problems.

When operating, the boiler water level is subject to *shrink and swell*. The specific volume of steam is dependent on the pressure of the surroundings; lower pressure steam takes up more space. When the main engine throttles are opened, the boiler pressure temporarily drops as the steam rushes to the turbine. This drop in pressure causes the steam bubbles remaining in the generating tubes to expand, forcing the water level in the drum to rise or *swell*. When the throttles are closed the reverse happens; the boiler pressure increases quickly, and compresses the steam bubbles, causing the water level to *shrink*. A properly adjusted two-element feed water regulator will respond properly to shrink and swell. For example, during swell conditions the drum level sensor sees high water and asks the regulating valve to close off, while at the same time, the steam flow sensor detects an increase in steam flow, and asks the regulating valve to open more. The two effects cancel each other out, and the regulating valve holds its position, which is the correct response, since the actual mass of water in the boiler really hasn't changed. Later as the drum pressure recovers, the swell subsides and the steam flow signal remains, causing the regulator to open a bit more. Close observation of the feed water regulator during maneuvering will be valuable if you are ever called upon to regulate the boiler water level manually.</Text>

            <Title>Arc Flash and Arc Blast</Title>
            <Text>Arc flash refers to the release of intense heat, light, and energy that occurs during an electrical fault or short circuit. It is characterized by a sudden and violent discharge of electrical energy through the air. The arc flash generates extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit (19,400 degrees Celsius). The intense heat emitted during an arc flash can cause severe burns to anyone in its vicinity. Additionally, the arc flash produces a bright flash of light, which can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment.
Arc blast, on the other hand, refers to the high-pressure shockwave produced by the rapid expansion of air during an arc flash. The rapid expansion of these vapors creates a blast wave that can cause significant physical damage. Arc blasts can result in powerful pressure waves, similar to those generated by an explosion, which can cause injuries, such as concussions, fractures, hearing loss, and even fatalities. The arc blast can propel debris, molten metal, and hot gases, further exacerbating the risk to individuals in the vicinity.</Text>

            <Title>Mechanical Energy</Title>
            <Text>Let’s consider first the two stored forms of mechanical energy.

Mechanical *potential* energy exists because of the relative positions of two or more objects. For example, a rock resting on the edge of a cliff in such a position that it will fall freely if pushed has mechanical potential energy. Water at the top of a dam has mechanical potential energy. A sled that is being held at the top of an icy hill has mechanical potential energy.

Mechanical *kinetic* energy exists because of the relative velocities of two or more objects. If you push that rock, open the gate of the dam, or let go of the sled, something will move. The rock will fall; the water will flow; the sled will slide down the hill. In each case the mechanical potential energy will be changed to mechanical kinetic energy. Another way of saying this is “energy of position will be changed to energy of motion.”

In these examples, you will notice that an external source of energy is used to get things started. Energy from some outside source is required to push the rock, open the gate of the dam, or let go of the sled. All real machines and processes require this kind of “boost” from an energy source outside the system. For example, there is a tremendous amount of chemical energy stored in fuel oil; but this energy will not raise steam in the boiler until you have expended some energy to start the oil burning. Similarly, the energy in any one system affects other energy systems. However, it is easier to learn the basic principles of energy if we forget about all the energy systems that might be involved in or affected by each energy process. In the examples given in this chapter, therefore, we will consider only one energy process or energy system at a time, disregarding both the energy “boosts” that may be received from outside systems and the energy transfers that may take place between the system we are considering and other systems.

Notice that both mechanical potential energy and mechanical kinetic energy are stored forms of energy. It is easy to see why we regard mechanical potential energy as being stored, but it is not so easy to see the same thing about mechanical kinetic energy. Part of the trouble comes about because mechanical kinetic energy is often referred to as “the energy of motion,” thus leading to the false conclusion that “energy in transition” is somehow involved. This is not the case, however. Work is the only form of mechanical energy that can be properly considered as energy in transition.

If you have trouble with the idea that mechanical kinetic energy is stored, rather than in transition, think of it like this. A bullet that has been fired from a gun has mechanical kinetic energy because it is in motion. The faster the bullet is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. There is no doubt in anybody’s mind that the bullet has the capacity to produce an effect, so we may safely say that it has energy. Although the bullet is in transition, the energy of the bullet is not transferred to any other object or system until the bullet strikes some object which resists its passage. When the bullet strikes against a resisting object, then, and only then, can we say that energy in transition exists, in the form of heat and work.

In this example, we are ignoring the fact that some work is done against the resistance of the air and that some heat results from the passage of the bullet through the air. But this does not change the basic idea that kinetic energy is stored energy rather than energy in transition. The air must merely be regarded as a “resisting object” which causes some of the stored kinetic energy of the bullet to be converted into energy in transition (heat and work) while the bullet is passing through the air. However, the major part of the stored kinetic energy does not become energy in transition until the bullet strikes an object firmer than air which resists its passage.

In the English system of units, mechanical potential energy is measured in foot-pounds. Consider, for example, the rock at the top of the cliff. If the rock weighs 5 pounds and if the distance from the rock to the earth at the base of the cliff is 100 feet, 500 foot-pounds of mechanical potential energy exist because of the relative positions of the rock and the earth. Another way of expressing this idea is by the formula:

\\[PE = mgh\\]

Where: 

\\(PE\\) = potential energy (in foot-pounds)  
\\(mg\\) = total weight of the object (in pounds)  
\\(h\\) = distance between the earth and the object (in feet)

Mechanical kinetic energy is also measured in foot-pounds. The amount of kinetic energy present at any one time is directly related to the velocity of the moving object and to the weight of the moving object.

\\[KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 \\]

Where:

\\(KE\\) = Kinetic energy  
\\(m\\) = Mass of object  
\\(v\\) = Velocity of object relative to earth

Mechanical potential energy can be changed into mechanical kinetic energy. If you push that 5-pound rock over the edge of the 100-foot cliff, it begins to fall, and, as it falls, it loses potential energy and gains kinetic energy. At any given moment, the total amount of mechanical energy (potential plus kinetic) stored in the system is the same - that is, 500 foot-pounds. But the proportions of potential energy and kinetic energy are changing all the time as the rock is falling. Just before the rock hits the earth, all the stored mechanical energy is kinetic energy. As the rock hits the earth, the kinetic energy is changed into energy in transition-that is, work and heat.

Mechanical kinetic energy can likewise be changed into mechanical potential energy. For example, suppose you throw a baseball straight up in the air. The ball has kinetic energy while it is motion, but the amount of kinetic energy decreases and the amount of potential energy increases as the ball travels upward. When the ball has reached its uppermost position, just before it starts to fall back to earth, it has only potential energy. Then, as it falls back toward the earth, the potential energy is changed into kinetic energy again.</Text>

            <Title>Reaction Turbines</Title>
            <Text>A simple rotary lawn sprinkler illustrates the operating principle of a reaction turbine. In the sprinkler, water emerges from the sprinkler nozzle at high velocity. The water moves slowly while it is in the hose; then it accelerates as it passes through the restriction of the nozzle. According to Newton's second law, \\(F = ma \\), there must be a force somewhere to cause this acceleration, and the force has to push, or react, against something. The thing it pushes against is the sprinkler rotor, and the reaction force causes the sprinkler head to turn in the direction opposite the emerging water jet.

The same principle turns the rotor of a reaction turbine, but in the turbine, the nozzles are the passages between the blades on the moving rotor. The blades in a reaction turbine are easy to distinguish from impulse turbine blades, because they are not symmetrical. In fact, in cross-section, they are shaped like the nozzle blades in Figref(blades.png), sort of a curved teardrop. The space between the moving blades forms a converging-diverging nozzle-shaped passage. In a reaction turbine the steam relative velocity increases and the pressure drops across each row of fixed and moving blades. The absolute steam velocity drops across the moving blades and the kinetic energy is extracted. A pressure velocity diagram for a reaction turbine is shown in Figref(reaction.png).

In an impulse turbine, the only pressure drop occurs across the nozzle, and the nozzle and the following rows of blades is considered a stage; in the reaction turbine, each row of moving blades has a pressure drop, so a stage is always one row of fixed blades followed by one row of moving blades. As the steam passes through the turbine, impulse or reaction, its pressure drops and its specific volume increases – that is, it expands. This expansion means that each subsequent turbine stage must be larger than the one before. Turbine blades in the first stage may be less than one inch tall, while the final stage blades can be as long as three feet.

Fig: turbines/reaction.png "Reaction Stage" class=left

A multi-stage reaction turbine is known as a *Parson's turbine*. In this design, the maximum power is developed when the blade speed equals the steam speed.

Because there is a pressure drop across the moving blades in a reaction turbine, the blade tips must be sealed to prevent leakage down the rotor. Tip sealing is less critical in the impulse turbine design.

It should be noted that while turbine designs can be categorized as impulse or reaction, this is a simplification. Real turbine blades always have both impulse and reaction characteristics to some degree, sometimes even changing along the length of the blade. Also, many turbines combine both impulse and reaction stages in the same unit. A common design for marine propulsion, for example, consists of an initial Curtis velocity-compounded, impulse stage, followed by several reaction stages. This design, known as an *impulse-reaction* turbine, has the advantage that it is more compact than a pure reaction turbine of the same horsepower.</Text>

            <Title>Smoke</Title>
            <Text>Fuel burns by chemically reacting with the oxygen in the air provided by the forced draft fans. An incorrect mixture of fuel and air will cause the boiler to produce smoke, which must be avoided to comply with environmental laws and maximize boiler efficiency.

Since the chemical reaction of the combustion process is understood, and we know that air contains about 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen, we can calculate precisely how many pounds of air are required to burn each pound of fuel completely. If the combustion control system admitted exactly this much air however, the combustion would still be incomplete, because we can't insure perfect mixing of all the air with the fuel. Some of the available oxygen would never reach the unburned fuel droplets. To avoid this problem, a properly operated boiler always provides some *excess air* beyond the amount theoretically required, to insure complete combustion. Too much excess air will cause unnecessary heat loss up the smokestack, reducing the boiler’s efficiency.

One way to monitor the amount of excess air is to watch the color of the smoke produced by the boiler. A properly operated boiler will have a colorless or light exhaust; black smoke indicates insufficient combustion air for the amount of fuel, and white smoke indicates the opposite. The boiler is equipped with a periscope smoke indicator which allows the operator to look through the stack to observe the color of the exhaust gases. The periscope should be checked frequently, and the fuel/air ratio adjusted as necessary to maintain a clear stack with a minimum of excess air. Be aware that a clear stack may still have too much air; try reducing the air until a light haze develops, then increase slightly. Be alert also that heavy white smoke appears black in the periscope because it completely blocks the light.

Watching the color of the smoke is a fairly crude method to maintain proper oxygen trim. A more precise method is to use an oxygen monitoring system to detect the level of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the stack gases and use it to adjust the excess air with a feedback control loop.</Text>

            <Title>DC Heater[dchtr]</Title>
            <Text>The direct contact (DC) heater provides a second stage of regenerative feed heating. In a direct contact heater, heat exchange occurs by mixing of the hot and cooler fluids, hence the name. Condensate is heated by either auxiliary exhaust steam or by intermediate pressure bleed steam. The condensate in the DC heater is at a saturated state, so its temperature can be determined from the pressure of the heating steam.

In addition to heating, the DC heater acts as a storage tank for condensate in the system, permitting minor fluctuation in the total amount of condensate contained within the cycle without causing disruption to the system. Finally, the DC heater acts as a deaerator, a device to remove corrosive dissolved oxygen from the condensate.

A change in terminology occurs at the bottom of the DC heater. From this point on, the condensate is referred to as *feed water*.

The DC heater is discussed in detail in [the DC Heater Chapter](#dcheaterchap).</Text>

When compiled (File&gt;Compile…), this project will generate a bare bones .tex document (using the flexible Memoir class) suitable for many types of work, fiction and non-fiction alike. The template achieves this by using advanced features available to the Plain Text compile file type, including providing the default extension of “.tex” instead of “.txt”. From that basic start you could build your own document design, or just as easily swap out the preamble components for something else entirely.

            <Title>Condenser Construction</Title>
            <Text>Fig: condensers/maincondenser1.png "Main Condenser" class=rotate

A typical main condensers is shown in Figref(maincondenser1.png), and consists of three main parts: the shell, the tubes, and the tube sheets. Cold sea water enters the shell at the *inlet water head* or *water box*, flows across the condenser through the tubes, and is discharged overboard at the circulating water outlet on the *outlet head*. Cooling water, supplied by the ocean, is delivered either by the *main circulating pump* or by the *scoop injection*. The scoop uses the motion of the vessel to move the water through the condenser, and can only be used when the ship is moving half ahead or faster. The main circ pump must be used when the vessel is maneuvering or stopped. Steam from the low pressure turbine enters the condenser at the top, flows downward around the tubes, condenses on the cold tube surfaces, and collects in the *hotwell* at the bottom, which acts as a condensate reservoir. Vent connections are provided in the waterboxes to prevent air from being trapped at the top of the water box, which would interrupt the water flow. Tube sheets are necessary to separate the water side from the steam side and support the tubes. The shell and water boxes of the condenser are made of welded steel plates, or of cast iron on smaller units, while tube sheets are frequently made of *Muntz metal*, which is a 60-40 copper-zinc alloy similar to brass.

A condenser may contain several thousand tubes in order to provide sufficient heat transfer surface to quickly condense all the main engine exhaust. For freshwater cooled condensers, tubes are made of stainless steel or admiralty metal, while for saltwater cooled condensers, a 90-10 copper-nickle alloy, which has excellent corrosion resistance, is used. The condenser tubes are arranged to form *steam lanes* which direct the steam deep into the tube bundle. Steam lanes help to distribute the steam evenly to all of the tubes, avoiding hot spots and under-utilized tubes, and they also direct a portion of the steam directly into the condensate in the hotwell to reheat and deaerate the condensate.

Because several dissimilar materials are used in the construction of the condenser, it is subject to corrosion due to electrolytic action. Zinc plates or rods, known as *sacrificial anodes* are mounted inside the condenser heads to protect the steel from corrosion damage. These zincs must be periodically inspected and replaced to insure continuous protection of the condenser. Another problem caused by multiple materials is that they have different rates of thermal expansion. The condenser is designed with sliding expansion joints in one of the tube sheets to allow the tubes to expand more than the shell without buckling.

The condenser shown in Figref(maincondenser1.png) is an example of a *single-pass* design. In this design, saltwater flows through the condenser once from the inlet to the outlet side. In a *double-pass* design, a division plate is installed in the inlet water box, separating it into two parts. Cooling water flows through half of the tubes, then turns 180° in the other water box and flows back through the other half of the tubes. In a double-pass condenser, the inlet and outlet piping and valves will all be at the same end of the condenser. For the same heat transfer area and water velocity, a single-pass condenser will require twice the water flow rate, and produce half the saltwater temperature rise of a double-pass condenser. The result is a lower condenser temperature leading to greater plant efficiency; however a single-pass condenser requires more power to drive the circulation pump. A condenser utilizing a scoop injection will always be of the single-pass design.</Text>

            <Title>DC Heater [dcheaterchap]</Title>
            <Text>The DC Heater is the point in the steam cycle where condensate becomes feed water. It serves three important functions:

**Deaeration.** The primary function of the DC Heater is to remove dissolved gases (oxygen and free carbon dioxide) from the condensate and make-up water used for boiler feed. Removal of oxygen and free carbon dioxide protects piping and pumps, as well as boilers and condensate return lines from these corrosive gases.

**Heating.** The second function of the DC Heater is to heat the feedwater prior to returning it to the boiler. Thermodynamically, it is known as the regenerative second stage heater. Using the exhaust steam from steam powered auxiliaries to heat the DC Heater increases the overall plant efficiency and saves fuel.

**Storage.** Finally the DC Heater acts as a storage location for feedwater. It acts as a surge tank for the system, allowing fluctuations in the amount of water contained in the cycle to occur without upsetting the feed pump and feedwater regulators.

The DC Heater has several different names. We primarily refer to it as the DC Heater, which is short for Direct Contact Heater, since it uses direct contact between steam and water for heating, however it is also known as the *deaerating feed tank*, the *DFT*, the *deaerator*, and the *second stage heater*. All these names refer to the same piece of equipment.

            <Title>Pumps</Title>
            <Text>
A *pump* is a device used to increase the pressure and move *liquids*, such as water or oil, or *slurries,* which are mixtures of liquids and solids, through pipes. If a pump is used to move gases, it is usually referred to as a *fan*, *compressor*, or *blower*.

The fluid inlet to the pump is called the *suction. *Fluid flows from the suction into the pump *chamber,* and then out the pump *discharge*. While the fluid is in the pump chamber, an external power source imparts energy to the fluid in order to:

-   move the fluid from a lower to a higher level
-   move the fluid from a lower to a higher pressure
-   overcome fluid friction in the passages and pipelines

Most of the energy from the external power source is transformed into usable fluid *pressure*, which is a form of potential energy, or into *velocity*, which increases the kinetic energy of the fluid. The remainder of the energy is absorbed by frictional losses in the pump and fluid passages, and shows up as heat. The fluid, now at a higher energy level, is led to the pump outlet called the discharge.

The external energy supplied to most pump shafts is in the form of torque, produced by electric motors, diesel or gas engines, or gas or steam turbines. Some pumps use a sliding, back-and-forth, external motion and are known as *reciprocating*. Pressurized gas or liquid is used as an energy source to operate a *jet type* pump.

The *capacity* of a pump is the volume of fluid that the pump can move (under specific operating conditions) per unit of time and is usually expressed as “Gallons per Minute” or “GPM” for short. The pressure that a pump is capable of delivering is described as the pump *head*, and will be discussed in the next section.</Text>

            <Text>Piping inlet and outlet connections are fitted to the body 180° apart *only,* similar to the straight globe valve. Piping connections to the body are the same as a globe valve: threaded, flanged, etc.

The body has two seats inside facing each other. One surrounds the inlet opening and the other the outlet opening. The distance between the seats nearest the bonnet opening is greater than the distance between the seats at the bottom of the valve body creating a wedge shape between them. The gate is moved down from the bonnet location between the two seats. It has a machined surface on both sides and has a wedge shape that matches the two seats forcing it to seal tightly against both seats when it is pushed down between them.

The upper part of the body and sometimes the lower part of the bonnet form a large cavity for the gate to retract into as the valve is opened. Since the gate slides off the seats sideways, it must be moved more than the full diameter of the seat opening to be fully open. This is why most gate valves are taller than globe valves of a comparable size.</Text>

            <Text>
Fig: pumps/gerotor.png "Gerotor Pump" class=left

The gerotor mechanism consists of pair of gear shaped elements, one within the other, mounted in a pump chamber, see Figref(gerotor.png). The inner gear is directly connected to the drive shaft and the source of power, and drives the outer gear through direct contact. The inner gear has one fewer teeth than the outer gear. The tooth form of each gear is related to that of the other in such a way that each tooth of the inner gear is always in sliding contact with the surface of the outer gear. Each meshing pair of teeth only fully engages at one point, 12 o’clock in the figure above.

On one side of the point of mesh, pockets of increasing size are formed as the gears rotate (suction pockets), while the pockets on the other side decrease in size (discharge pockets).</Text>

            <Text>Head injuries are caused by falling or flying objects, or by bumping your head against a fixed object. Head protection, in the form of protective hats, must do two things – resist penetration and absorb the shock of the blow. This is accomplished by making the shell of the hat of a material hard enough to resist the blow, and by utilizing a shock-absorbing lining composed of headband and crown straps to keep the shell away from the wearer’s skull. Protective hats are also used to protect against electric shock.</Text>

            <Title>Blowing Tubes</Title>
            <Text>Combustion gases leave ash or soot deposits on the tube surfaces which reduce heat transfer to the boiler water. Soot blowers are used to remove this soot from the tube surfaces, either using steam or high pressure compressed air to blow the soot off of the tube surfaces. Tubes are normally blown once or twice a day when at sea, before and after leaving port, and after boiler casualties which cause heavy smoke.

Fig: boilers/sootblower.png "Sootblower"

A steam powered rotary soot blower is shown in Figref(sootblower.png). The element, a long pipe with several spray holes, is turned manually with a chain or automatically by an air powered motor. Rotating the element also turns a cam which opens the steam valve when the nozzles are pointing in the desired direction. In the design shown, the sootblower element always remains in the furnace, and must be continuously cooled or it will overheat. This is accomplished by circulating a small amount of *scavenging air* through the element when it is not in service. The source of the scavenging air is the pressurized combustion air in the boiler double casing. A check valve installed in the scavenging line prevents steam from entering the air casing during soot blower operation. In other sootblower designs, the element can be completely retracted from the furnace and is only inserted during the soot blowing operation. </Text>

            <Text>The *Patriot State* High Pressure turbine is shown in Figref(PS_HP1.png) and Figref(PS_HP2.png).

This HP turbine is equipped with eight Rateau pressure-compounded stages for ahead operation. High pressure, superheated steam from the throttle enters the *high pressure head* (16), which distributes the steam to 13 *uncontrolled nozzles* and to four hand operated nozzle control valves (15). These valves control the flow of steam through additional groups of nozzles, which gives the operator the ability to control the number of nozzles in use, in order to maintain maximum efficiency at different operating conditions. Proper adjustment of the hand valves permits the turbine to be operated with the main throttle valve fully open over a wide range of powers, and thus minimize throttle losses. After leaving the first stage nozzles, the steam flows forward to aft through the eight HP turbine stages, and then exits through the crossover pipe.</Text>

            <Text>Conduction is the method by which heat flows from a hotter to a colder substance when there is physical contact between the two substances. For example, consider a cold metal bar which is held firmly against a piece of red-hot metal. In a short time, the end of the bar which is not touching the hotter metal will have become too hot to hold. We say that heat has been conducted from molecule to molecule, throughout the entire bar. The process of conduction will continue as long as there is a temperature difference between the two ends of the bar.

            <Title>By Delivery Characteristics</Title>
            <Text>All shaft driven pumps will deliver liquids at different volume rates if they are run at different speeds. Most pump designs require a change in speed to change their capacity (*constant delivery*). However, some rotary type pumps, and some radial or axial piston pumps are designed to vary the quantity of liquid delivered while maintaining the prime mover at a single speed. Pumps with these characteristics are known as *variable delivery* pumps.

Variable delivery pumps are most commonly found in hydraulic systems, where the delivery rate can be adjusted to control the rate of motion of hydraulic cylinders and actuators.</Text>

These pumps can be started with no liquid in the pump chamber and will pump the air out of the suction pipe, lowering the pressure, eventually causing the liquid to lift up and enter the pump. These types of pumps are considered to be *self-priming*.

Other types of pumps, because of larger internal clearances, will not pump air or gases and will not lower the pressure in the suction pipe enough to lift the liquid to the pump chamber. These types of pumps must have the suction pipe and the pump chamber completely flooded with the liquid to be pumped or they will not lift the liquid. Filling the suction pipe and pump chamber with liquid to place these pumps in operation is called *priming* the pump.</Text>

            <Title>Generation</Title>
            <Text>Steam generation occurs in the boiler. The boiler is simply a device used to boil water. Like a tea-kettle on the stove, it contains liquid water and a heat source. As the water is heated, its temperature rises and soon it begins to boil. On the stove, the water vapor or steam rises and dissipates into the kitchen, but not so in a boiler. The boiler is a closed vessel, like a pot with a lid, and any steam generated in the boiler rises to the top and is collected before being sent on to the next step of the cycle.

In the generation stage, the chemical energy stored in the ship’s fuel is released when the fuel is burned in the boiler furnace, and some of this energy is transferred to the working fluid – the water. The water gains energy, and we can detect this in two ways: the water’s temperature goes up, and the water changes *state* from a liquid into water vapor, which we call steam. Steam leaves the boiler at high pressure and high temperature.

As discussed in [Principles of Thermodymamics] (#principlesofthermodynamics), heat energy that raises the temperature of a substance such as water or steam is sometimes called *sensible heat* while the heat energy that actually boils the substance is called *latent heat*.

You probably remember that water boils at 212 °F at standard atmospheric pressure (14.7 psia). If you put a thermometer into a pan of water boiling on the stove, this is what it will read. Even if you turn the flame up to add more heat energy, you won’t be able to make the water temperature rise above 212 °F. This is because you are adding latent heat, which is not reflected by an increase in the water’s temperature. All of the heat energy is being used to turn the liquid water into a vapor.

The boiling or condensing temperature of a liquid is known as its *saturation* temperature. The saturation temperature for a particular liquid is determined by its pressure, and cannot be changed. For example, 212 °F is the saturation temperature for water at atmospheric pressure, and there is nothing anybody can do to change it.

In order to reach high steam temperatures, which is necessary for high steam cycle efficiency, the boiler must be operated at a pressure far above atmospheric pressure. A typical marine boiler operates at about 600 psi while some have operated as high as 1200 psi, although this introduces additional maintenance difficulties. Shoreside steam power plants operate at 3000 psi or even higher.

Steam temperature is raised even further by superheating the steam. Superheating steam raises its temperature above the saturation temperature for the corresponding steam pressure by continuing to add heat to the steam after it has completely vaporized. This must take place in a separate area, called the *superheater,* away from liquid water, or the additional heat would simply boil more water rather than superheating the steam. Superheated steam is said to be *dry*, which means that all liquid water has vaporized and it contains no moisture droplets. Drops of liquid water would damage the turbine in the expansion step described below.

Improving efficiency is a major concern of mechanical and marine engineers. High efficiency means that fuel is not wasted, and operating costs are minimized. Practical boiler designs incorporate many techniques to maximize efficiency. For example, not all of the chemical energy originally contained by the fuel ends up transferred to the steam. A large portion of this energy is lost up the smokestack, carried away by the combustion gases. Practical boilers usually contain some sort of heat exchanger in the smokestack in an effort to recover some of this energy.</Text>

            <Title>Eye Protection</Title>
            <Text>Every day more than 1,000 eye injuries occur in American workplaces. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that three out of five workers who suffered eye injuries were not wearing eye protective equipment at the time of the accident, and when asked why, the victims often claimed that eye protection was not normally used in their type of work, or it was not required for the type of work performed at the time of the accident. Eye protection can save your sight, but you must be wearing it.

Eye injuries can occur in many ways, but are primarily caused by rapidly flying objects. The BLS found that almost 70% of eye injuries were caused by flying or falling objects or sparks striking the eye. Most of these objects were smaller than a pin head, and were traveling faster than a hand-thrown object. Another 20% of eye injuries were caused by chemicals, and the remainder due to miscellaneous causes such as objects swinging into the eye, pulled into the eye or by light radiation.

Eye injuries can be prevented by wearing effective eye protection. To be effective, the eyewear must be of the appropriate type for the hazard encountered and properly fitted. The BLS survey found that 94% of the injuries to workers wearing eye protection were caused by objects or chemicals going around or under the protector. Goggles provide better protection than face shields or safety glasses, but the best protection is afforded when both goggles and a face shield are worn together.</Text>

            <Text>An oil operated regulating valve is provided to maintain the necessary pressure in the gland sealing system. When the turbine is running at normal operating speed, leak-off steam from the high pressure turbine glands is sufficient to seal the LP turbine glands which are under a vacuum. At low loads, additional sealing steam is required, which is provided from the auxiliary steam line. At high loads, there is an excess of sealing steam, which is then discharged to the main condenser. The regulating valve senses the gland seal system pressure, and compensates accordingly under all of these conditions.</Text>

            <Title>Main Engine</Title>
            <Text>The propulsion system of a ship is known as the *Main Engine.*In a steamship, the heat energy of the fuel is used to create steam in the boiler. The energy contained in the steam is converted by the main engine into rotational energy, which ultimately turns the propeller that drives the ship through the water.

The main engine of a steamship typically consists of two high-speed steam turbines with steam flowing through them in series. These two turbines are mechanically connected in parallel to a reduction gear which turns the propeller shaft. These devices work together to drive a single propeller at speeds up to about 120 revolutions per minute in either direction. The main engine also includes the lubrication and governing systems necessary for the safe operation of the turbines and gears. These items will be discussed in this chapter.

Steam turbines are used for many different purposes aboard ship and in facilities ashore. The principles of design and operation of propulsion turbines discussed in this chapter apply to all turbines, including those used to drive auxiliary machinery, and for large electrical generators in power plants.</Text>

            <Title>Vane Pumps</Title>
            <Text>In this type of pump, the rotor is fitted with a number of slots into which movable vanes are installed. The pump chamber is larger in diameter than the rotor and the rotor is offset in the pump chamber so that they almost come in contact with each other at the 12 o’clock position and are separated by some distance at the 6 o’clock position. As the rotor revolves, the vanes are thrown out by centrifugal force to bear against the inside surface of the pump chamber. (Liquid pressure behind the vanes also pushes them in contact with the chamber wall and sometimes springs are used behind the vanes to force them against the chamber wall) As the rotor turns from the 12 o’clock position to the 6 o’clock position, it moves away from the chamber wall and liquid flows into the space between the moving vanes. From approximately the 5 o’clock to the 7 o’clock position, the liquid is trapped between two vanes, the rotor and the chamber wall and is pushed to the discharge side of the pump. As the rotor revolves back to the 12 o’clock position, the space between the rotor and the chamber wall decreases, forcing the liquid to the discharge connection on the pump casing. Different designs of vanes may be used, as shown in Figref(vane.png), but the sliding vane type is most common.

            <Title>Boiler Water Treatment</Title>
            <Text>Boiler water must be treated chemically to avoid problems such as Scale, Corrosion, Sludge Formation, and Foaming. Scale is caused by impurities such as calcium and magnesium precipitating out of the water, and by suspended solids settling out and adhering to the tube surfaces. Scale deposits on the tubes act as thermal insulation which reduces the heat transfer across the tubes and increases the tube temperatures. Corrosion due to dissolved oxygen attacks the iron of the tubes and leads to its deterioration. Untreated sludge will bake onto the heat transfer surfaces and cause overheating, and suspended solids will cause a foam to form in the steam drum leading to carryover.

The boiler water must be tested and boiler chemicals added each day to maintain correct pH levels to limit corrosion, and for correct phosphate levels, which help to precipitate out calcium and magnesium. Periodic surface blowdowns are conducted on a steaming boiler to remove suspended solids, lower the conductivity, and remove dissolved substances contained in the water. Sludge accumulations in the mud drum and headers are removed by conducting bottom blows. A boiler can only receive a bottom blow when it is secured, since blowing a steaming boiler could interrupt the natural circulation flow and cause tube overheating.</Text>

            <Title>Boiler Construction</Title>
            <Text>A cutaway view of a typical marine boiler is shown in Figref(sg-0008.png). This boiler is described as a *water-tube*, D-Type, accelerated natural circulation boiler, because its tubes contain the water and steam, not combustion gases; are arranged roughly like the letter *D*; and because the water circulates through the boiler without a pump, purely due to differences in the density of the water and steam. Early marine boilers, and some auxiliary boilers today are designated *fire-tube* boilers, because the hot exhaust gases products of combustion pass through the tubes, and the water surrounds the tubes. Other boiler designs and auxiliary boilers will be discussed in more detail in later courses at MMA, either *Steam Generators* for marine engineers, or *Commercial Boilers* for facilities engineers.

Steam is generated by burning fuel in the furnace, heating and boiling the water contained inside the tubes and the drums at the top and bottom of the boiler. The gases of combustion flow over the tubes, and since the water temperature within the tubes is lower than the gas temperature, heat flows from the combustion gases into the water. As the heat flows into the water, the water temperature starts to rise, and continues to rise until the water begins to boil. The boiling water forms vapor bubbles like those seen on the bottom of a pan on the stove. The specific volume of these vapor or steam bubbles is about 1600 times greater than the specific volume of the surrounding water. Since density is the inverse of specific volume, the steam bubbles float and rise up to the highest point, the *steam drum*. From there, the steam is collected and directed into the superheater tubes, where it picks up additional heat energy, and then is sent on to the main engine as superheated steam to propel the ship or serve other functions.

The main components of the boiler will be described in this section.</Text>

            <Title>Thermal Energy</Title>
            <Text>All substances are composed of molecules. The energy associated with molecules is called thermal energy. Thermal energy, like mechanical energy, exists in two stored forms and in one transitional form. The two stored forms of thermal energy are called internal potential energy, and internal kinetic energy. Thermal energy in transition is called *heat.*

Although molecules are too small to be seen, they behave in some ways pretty much like the larger objects we considered in the discussion of mechanical energy. Molecules have energy of position (internal potential energy) because of the forces which attract molecules to each other. In this way, they are somewhat like the rock and the earth we considered before. Molecules have energy of motion (internal kinetic energy) because they are constantly in motion. Thus, the two stored forms of thermal energy-internal potential energy and internal kinetic energy-are in some ways similar to mechanical potential energy and mechanical kinetic energy, except that everything is on a smaller scale.</Text>

            <Title>Impulse Turbines</Title>
            <Text>The simplest impulse turbine consists of one or more nozzles followed by a row of moving blades. See Figref(blades.png). The fixed nozzles are held in position on a fixed disk known as a *diaphragm*, and are designed to direct the steam towards the blades at the proper angle. In some designs, the nozzles are drilled passages through the diaphragm, while in others they are the curved passages between *nozzle blades*. The turbine blades, or *buckets*, are mounted on a rotating *wheel* which is attached to the rotor shaft. Impulse blades are easily recognized by their shape: they are usually symmetrical, with entrance and exit angles of about 20°. A *shroud band* surrounds the blades to prevent leakage at the top of the buckets, and to prevent the blades from vibrating. This configuration is known as a single-stage impulse turbine or a *de Laval turbine* after Carl Gustav Patrick de Laval, a Swedish engineer who also invented the centrifugal cream separator. De Laval’s separator is still used aboard ship to remove water and dirt from lubricating and fuel oils.

In an impulse stage, the steam jet leaves the fixed nozzles and hits the row of moving blades which creates an impact on the blades; at the same time, the blades reverse the direction of the steam jet. The power developed by the stage is the product of the torque on the rotor times the rotor speed. When the rotor is stationary, steam leaves the row of blades at the same speed that it entered, and this produces maximum torque on the rotor; but since the shaft speed is zero, no power is produced. As the rotor speeds up, the relative steam exit velocity decreases, and the torque on the rotor decreases, but the power developed goes up, up to a point, before it starts to decline again at sufficiently high rotor speeds. The maximum power developed by a de Leval impulse stage occurs when the blade speed is one half of the steam speed.

The de Laval turbine is not commonly used, because with only one row of nozzles all the pressure drop must occur in one step. This leads to very high steam velocities exiting the nozzle, and for high efficiency, the turbine speed must be very high too – often too high to be useful. Also, with only one row of blades, the exiting steam still has significant kinetic energy, which is lost. A simple de Laval turbine just can’t efficiently absorb too much steam energy, and is unsuitable for any but the smallest applications.

Impulse turbine efficiency can be improved by using multiple turbine stages, where a turbine stage is defined as the portion of the turbine where a single pressure drop occurs. In an impulse turbine, pressure drop only occurs in the nozzles, so a pressure stage consists of one row of nozzles followed by one or more rows of moving blades. Multi-stage impulse turbines are built in three ways: *pressure compounded*, *velocity compounded*, and *pressure-velocity compounded.*

An impulse turbine or turbine stage is characterized by the fact that nearly all of the pressure drop occurs in the nozzles, with no significant pressure drop occurring across the blades. Any pressure drop that does occur across the blades is due to friction, not velocity changes.</Text>

**Disposable foam plugs.** Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each person’s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better.

**Reusable, pre-molded plugs.** Pre-molded plugs are made from silicone, plastic or rubber and are manufactured as either “one-size-fits-most” or are available in several sizes. Be sure to choose the proper size for your ear canals. In some cases, different size plugs may be required for each ear. The advantage of pre-molded plugs are that they are inexpensive, reusable, washable, convenient to carry, and come in a variety of sizes. Nearly everyone can find a plug that will be comfortable and effective. Another advantage is that in a dirty environment like the engine room, you don’t need to handle or roll the tips. You insert this type of plug by reaching over your head with one hand to pull up on your ear. Then use your other hand to insert the plug with a gentle rocking motion until you have sealed the ear canal.

**Hearing Bands.** Hearing Bands, also called canal caps or semi-insert devices often resemble earplugs on a flexible plastic or metal band. The earplug tips of a canal cap may be a formable or pre-molded material. Some have headbands that can be worn over the head, behind the neck or under the chin. The main advantage of canal caps is their convenience They are easy to put on and take off . When it’s quiet, employees can leave the band hanging around their necks, but they can quickly insert the plug tips when hazardous noise starts again. These devices are ideal for intermittent use, but they provide less protection then either plugs or muffs. Some people find the pressure from the bands uncomfortable.

&gt;**What is a Decibel?**

&gt;The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first let’s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power *P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*, and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power *P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*, but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* dB where the log is to base 10. If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 2 = 3 dB. If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 10 = 10 dB. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 1,000,000 = 60 dB. This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size.

&gt;Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, *p*. The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of *x* is just 2 log *x*, this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with *p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*and *p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* is defined as: 20 log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) dB where the log is to base 10. This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. (This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers (Walkmans) are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries.) So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that 20 log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) = 86 dB where *p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;* is the sound pressure of the reference level, and *p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) = 4.3 dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long.

&gt;What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level = 20 log (*p*&lt;sub&gt;measured&lt;/sub&gt; /*p*&lt;sub&gt;reference&lt;/sub&gt; ) = 20 log 1 = 0 dB. So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals.</Text>

            <Title>Slips, trips and falls</Title>
            <Text>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, slips, trips, and falls cause nearly 700 fatalities per year and many more injurious accidents in the workplace,
Common trip and fall hazards include obstructions on walkways, such as cables, tools, or equipment left in pathways. Uneven surfaces, loose gratings, and obstructions, can also contribute to tripping incidents. Additionally, poor lighting, cluttered work areas, improper storage of materials, and inadequate lighting can increase the risk of trips and falls.  
Spilled liquids, oils, or water can make surfaces extremely slippery. Wet surfaces due to cleaning or maintenance activities, and the presence of loose debris are additional factors that can contribute to slip incidents.
Falls can be particularly dangerous when you are working at above the ground, such as on a ladder, scaffolding or staging.
Falling objects such as tools, equipment, materials, or debris can potentially cause serious injuries or fatalities.  When tools and are stored haphazardly or left unsecured, they are susceptible to falling on someone. 
Aboard ship, additional hazards exist due to the dynamic and often wet environment. Obstructions such as hatch combings, pad-eyes and container hold-downs can cause individuals to trip. Slip hazards arise from seawater or rainwater on deck surfaces, spilled liquids in galley areas, or lubricants used for machinery maintenance.  In rough seas, the motion of the ship can cause unsecured objects to fall, or cause you to lose your balance and fall. You must be particularly careful when working at heights or over the side. Always follow the old adage, “one hand for the ship and one hand for yourself.</Text>

            <Text>Bore
:    The bore is the inside diameter (ID) of the cylinder, usually measured in inches.

Stroke
:    The stroke of a pump is the maximum distance the piston can travel from one end of the cylinder to the other, usually measured in inches.

Single stroke
:    The motion of the piston from one extreme to the other.

Double stroke
:    The motion of the piston from one end of the cylinder to the other and back to its original starting point. It is equal in distance to two single strokes. It is also a complete operating cycle for that piston (piston has returned to its original starting point and now the cycle repeats.)

Single-acting
:    A single acting pump uses only one side of the piston to pump liquid. It is normally the side not attached to the piston rod or the connecting rod.

Double-acting
:    A double acting pump is fitted with suction and discharge valves on both sides of the piston, allowing the piston to pump liquid on both strokes of the pump cycle.

Direct-acting
:    The engine used is a steam reciprocating engine. The steam piston is pushed back and forth in the steam cylinder and the rod attached to the steam piston extends into the liquid cylinder and is directly attached to the liquid piston in the reciprocating pump. The engine produces the mechanical motion the reciprocating pistons require, hence; direct-acting.

Indirect-acting
:    The power sources provide rotary motion to this type of reciprocating pump. The rotary motion of the power supply source must be converted to reciprocating motion at the pistons using a mechanical device called a crankshaft.

Simplex
:    Only one liquid cylinder and piston are built into the pump. They may be operated by a steam reciprocating engine or more commonly today from a rotary engine via a crankshaft and connecting rod.

Duplex
:    Two liquid cylinders and pistons are built into a common pump housing. Each cylinder may be operated by its own separate reciprocating engine. (with both engines built into the common housing) More commonly today, they are driven from a rotary engine via a crankshaft and connecting rods.

Triplex
:    Three liquid cylinders and pistons are built into a common pump housing. Normally driven by a rotary engine via a crankshaft and connecting rods. Although direct-acting and indirecting-acting pumps can be built with more than three cylinders, they are not very common.</Text>

            <Title>Shaft seals</Title>
            <Text>Turbine *glands* seal the turbine shaft at both ends where it penetrates the casing. In small turbines, rings of carbon packing are used to form the seal, but in propulsion turbines the job is accomplished with labyrinth packing and gland sealing steam. Visible in Figref(PS_HP2.png), labyrinth packing consists of thin strips of metal which fit into matching grooves on the shaft with a small clearance between. This small clearance acts to reduce leakage along the shaft, but any misalignment or distortion will cause the seal strips to rub and the resulting friction will cause overheating of the turbine and damage the seals.

No matter how many rows of labyrinth packing are installed, some steam will always leak past the glands when the pressure inside the turbine is greater than the surrounding atmospheric pressure. This steam leakage is undesirable, because the lost condensate must be replaced in the steam cycle, and because it raises the humidity in the engine room, making the atmosphere there uncomfortable. Rather than permitting this steam to escape to the engine room, it is captured and recovered by the *gland leak-off* system and *gland exhaust condenser*.

A different problem occurs when the pressure in the turbine is below atmospheric pressure. Under these conditions, instead of steam leaking out of the turbine, air leaks in. When air leaks into the turbine casing it also enters the condenser, and when air enters the condenser faster than the air ejector can remove it, the condenser vacuum will be lost. To prevent this loss of vacuum, low pressure, 1-2 psi, *gland sealing steam* is introduced at the turbine glands to complete the seal.</Text>

            <Title>Construction[gatevalvecontstruction]</Title>
            <Text>Globe valves are designed for tight closure and throttling applications. When a globe valve is used to throttle or regulate fluid flow, the disk surface that closes against the seat should be made from metal, not synthetic materials. Throttling a fluid creates erosion (wearing away) of the disk surface and the seat surface that the fluid flows between. This erosion may show up as general roughness or as small grooves cut across the surfaces of the seat and disk, called *wire drawing*. These defects on the precisely machined surfaces of the seat and disk result in leakage when the valve is closed. In service where erosion will be a problem, the seat and disk can be fabricated from very hard materials, such as stellite, to extend the life of the seat and disk contact surfaces.

The *valve body* contains the internal opening that the fluid flows through. It is called the *seat* if the opening is machined directly into the valve body material. It is called a *seat ring* if it is a separate and replaceable part from the valve body. Replaceable seat rings are generally manufactured from harder, longer wearing materials than the valve body to be more resistant to fluid erosion at this location. Seat rings may be retained in the valve body by machine screw threads, press fit, welding or by what is known as a *shrink fit*. In shrink fit applications, the machined hole in the valve body that the seat ring fits into is a few thousandths of an inch smaller in diameter than the outside diameter of the seat ring. Therefore, it is impossible for the ring to fit into the hole in the valve body. During assembly the valve body is heated, causing the machined seat ring hole to expand. The seat ring is also frozen at the same time to decrease its outside diameter. With both parts at the proper temperature, the seat ring now has an outside diameter that is smaller than the inside diameter of the machined hole in the valve body. At this point, the seat ring is placed quickly and accurately into the valve body. As the temperature of the two parts begin to equalize, the ring expands and the machined hole shrinks and places a compressive force around the outside of the ring, locking it very tightly in place.

The valve body has two external openings (and in some special valves, more) for the entrance and exit of fluid from the piping system. These openings can be connected to the piping using pipe threads, soldering, flanges, welding, or gluing.

The top of the valve body generally has an opening for the valve disk and stem to fit through. At this opening, the other sub-assembly, called the *bonnet* is attached.

The *bonnet* normally contains the equipment necessary to operate the movable disk. It is attached to the body by machine screw threads or flanges . Large valves and valves in high pressure service normally have a gasket between the bonnet and the body made from sheet packing, flat metallic rings or spiral wound metallic type material. Small valves may have the bonnet and body sealed by a lapped metal to metal fit with no gaskets.

Fig: valves/osborneglobe.png "Angle Globe Valve" class=right   
**Construction Details.** Several interesting construction details are shown in Figref(osborneglobe.png), which shows a manually operated right-angle globe valve.

This valve has a *stem* with a collar machined on the end. The *disk* slides over the collar and is retained on the end of the stem by a *valve disk plug* (or *disk nut*) which is attached to the disk by machine threads. Since the disk plug is prevented from sliding off the end of the stem by the collar, it effectively fastens the disk to the stem. The disk nut does not lock the disk tightly to the stem, rather the disk is allowed to move slightly around the collar on the end of the valve stem. This small movement allows the disk to align itself properly with the seat as it closes for a leak free seal. In this valve, the stem is also the device that keeps the disk correctly aligned with the seat, regardless of how far the disk is removed from the seat.

Where the valve stem passes through the bonnet to the outside of the valve, the bonnet has a *stuffing box*, *packing*, and a *packing gland* installed to minimize fluid leakage at this point.

This valve stem has *Acme Threads*, a thread type with no points, just below the point where the *hand-wheel* is installed. The valve stem threads engage the internal threads of the *yolk bushing*, which is made from a softer material than the valve stem, e.g. bronze, brass etc. If the stem has too much rotational force applied, the yoke bushing threads strip instead of the valve stem threads. The yoke bushing is a replaceable part and is screwed into the upper part of the bonnet with machine threads. When the valve hand-wheel is turned in the clockwise direction, the valve stem threads engaged with the yoke bushing threads cause the stem to move inward pushing the disk toward the seat closing the valve.

The upper part of the bonnet on this particular valve is split into two supporting uprights from the area where the packing gland is installed to the location of the yoke bushing. This type of upper bonnet design is called an *outside yolk and stem*.</Text>

            <Title>Respiratory Protection</Title>
            <Text>A respirator is a face piece, hood, or helmet that is designed to protect the user from a variety of harmful airborne agents. Respirators can protect you from dust and particulates in the air, hazardous vapors, oxygen deficiency, or a combination of these. Respirators are not necessary for routine operations in the engine room, but may be advisable during certain maintenance procedures such as chipping and painting.

OSHA regulations require that respirators shall be used in the following circumstances:

-   Where exposure levels exceed the *permissible exposure limit* (PEL),     during the time period necessary to install or implement feasible     engineering and work practice controls;
-   In those maintenance and repair activities and during those brief or     intermittent operations where exposures exceed the PEL and     engineering and work practice controls are not feasible or are not     required;
-   In regulated areas;
-   Where the employer has implemented all feasible engineering and work     practice controls and such controls are not sufficient to reduce     exposures to or below the PEL; and,
-   In emergencies.

Before using a respirator you should be thoroughly trained in its use. Some of the areas that you should be familiar with include: respiratory hazards; respirator selection criteria, limitations, adjustment, fit, cleaning, and storage procedures, etc. The selection of a suitable respirator depends on the hazard to which you are exposed, and the correct respirator cannot be selected without a thorough understanding of the hazard.</Text>

            <Title>By Displacement Characteristics</Title>
            <Text>A *positive displacement* pump is one in which a definite volume of liquid is delivered for each cycle of pump operation, regardless of the discharge pressure the pump operates against, and provided the capacity of the power unit driving the pump is not exceeded.

A non-positive displacement pump is one in which the volume of liquid delivered for each operational pump cycle depends on the resistance to flow in the discharge line. This type of pump produces a force on the liquid that is constant for each particular operating speed of the pump. Pressure in the discharge line produces a force in the opposite direction. When these two forces are equal, the liquid is in a state of equilibrium and does not flow.

If the discharge valve of a positive displacement pump is completely closed, the discharge pressure will rise to a point where either the unit driving the pump will stall or parts of the pump exposed to discharge pressure will fail. This situation should be avoided. On the other hand, closing the discharge valve on a non-positive displacement pump will cause the discharge pressure to rise to a maximum for that type of pump operating at a specific speed. Nothing more will happen except the pump will churn the liquid trapped in the pump chamber and produce frictional heat in the liquid.

Most positive displacement pumps deliver liquid in slugs, with no delivery in between, and this causes a rise then a drop in discharge pressure and flow. Pumps equipped with many small pumping chambers generally have overlapping delivery that minimizes this effect. Non-positive displacement pumps deliver a practically continuous even flow for a given operating speed and discharge pressure.</Text>

            <Title>Stop Check</Title>
            <Text>A stop-check valve is very similar to a globe valve, except that the disk is not attached to the stem. When the valve hand-wheel is turned to the fully closed position the disk is held against the seat and the valve is securely closed. When the valve hand-wheel is turned to open the valve, the disk is free to lift off the seat, and will when there is a pressure difference in the correct direction. If the flow reverses direction, the valve will automatically close like a lift check valve.

The valve stem can be used to force the disk to a partially closed position to regulate the flow, or to a fully closed position to stop the flow, but the valve stem cannot be used to force the disk into the open position. Once the stem is moved away from the disk, the valve functions like a lift check valve.

A typical application would be a boiler feedwater stop-check valve. The valve can be used to stop or regulate feedwater flow to the boiler. It also automatically prevents the back flow of water out of the boiler through the feedwater line if the pressure in the feedwater line falls below the boiler steam pressure. In this application, it functions as a check valve.

In some designs, a stop-check valve can be converted to a regular globe valve, which eliminates the check function and allows the disk to be forced into the open position, by reinstalling the disk nut or drilling a hole through the upper disk and valve stem and inserting a pin to lock them together.</Text>

            <Title>Types of Respirators</Title>
            <Text>OSHA divides respirators into two categories:

Fig: ppe/respirators1.jpg "Air-purifying respirator" class=right

**Air-purifying Respirators.** These units have filters, cartridges, or canisters that remove contaminants from the air by passing the air through the air-purifying element before it reaches the user. Air purifying respirators are further divided into:

-   *Particulate Respirators*, which capture particles such as dusts,     paint fumes, and mists, but do not protect against gases and vapors.     The filters in particulate respirators generally work better as     particles accumulate on the filter. If the filter becomes so clogged     that it is difficult to breathe, it should be replaced.

-   *Gas and Vapor Respirators*, which use a chemical cartridge or     canister to remove dangerous gases or vapors, but which do not     protect against airborne particles. These units only protect against     specific gases or vapors, and only provide protection as long as the     filter’s absorbing capacity remains.

-   *Combination Respirators*, which can be used in atmospheres that     contain both hazardous gases and particles.

Fig: ppe/respirators2.jpg "Atmosphere-supplying respirators" class=right

**Atmosphere-supplying Respirators.** These units supply clean air directly to the user from a source other than the air surrounding the user. The types of air-supplying respirators are:

-   *Air Supplied Respirators*, which have a hose which connects to a     source of clean air under pressure. These units have no time limit on the air supply, but the hose limits the range and mobility of the user and is susceptible to damage.

-   *Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus*, which have a wearable     clean-air supply pack. These units have better mobility than the air-supplied respirator, but the clean air time is limited to the     capacity of the tank.

-   *Combination Respirators*, which are similar to the air-supplied     respirators, but also have a small, self-contained air supply which     can be used for escape if the primary supply fails.

            <Title>Low Oil Pressure Relay</Title>
            <Text>A low oil pressure relay is located in the lower half of the forward bearing bracket of the high pressure turbine, and shown in cross section at A-A. This relay senses bearing-oil pressure and acts to close the ahead throttle whenever the lube oil pressure drops below a safe value. During normal operation, 12 psi bearing-oil holds a relay piston against its seat and directs 35 psi control-oil to the pilot valve in the maneuvering valve. If bearing-oil pressure is lost, control-oil pressure unseats the relay and drains the maneuvering valve control-oil line, causing the ahead throttle valve to be closed by the action of the spring. When bearing-oil pressure is restored, the relay piston is again seated to allow control-oil to flow through the open ports to the maneuvering valve. The ahead valve is thus opened automatically to admit steam to the turbines.</Text>

            <Title>Boilers</Title>
            <Text>Marine boilers provide the steam to turn the propeller, power the generators, make fresh water, operate steam driven pumps and blowers, heat the quarters, support the galley, and meet all other steam requirements of the ship. Operation of the boilers is critical to the operation of the vessel, and marine engineers must have a thorough understanding of boilers in order to operate them safely and economically. Boilers can be dangerous. Improper actions or inactions can lead to a boiler explosion, likely killing everyone in the engine room and perhaps everyone on the ship. The US Coast Guard requires all operators of marine boilers to be competent, and you can not operate a boiler until you have been trained, acquired the required sea experience, and passed the US Coast Guard license exam. Coast Guard Licensing requirements came about as a result of many tragic boiler explosions in the early years of steam propulsion, including the explosion of the *Sultana*, which killed over 1500 Union soldiers returning home from Vicksburg, Mississippi in April 1865.

There are many different types of marine boilers. Boilers on steam driven ships are considered *propulsion boilers*, and are designed to meet the large steam demands of the main engines, as well as all the other steam requirements of the vessel. Diesel and gas turbine powered ships are equipped with smaller *auxiliary boilers* to supply the steam requirements of these vessels. Propulsion boilers are normally fired with heavy fuel oil, or in a few cases today, coal, while the heat source for auxiliary boilers is either fuel oil, diesel oil, or the waste heat from the main propulsion diesel or gas turbine. Marine boilers, while similar to boilers found ashore, are designed to meet the particular requirements of shipboard use. They are designed to be light and compact to fit into small engine rooms, capable of operating under rapidly changing loads when the vessel is maneuvering, and to operate reliably while the vessel is pitching and rolling during a storm.

In this chapter we will briefly discuss the construction and operation of a main propulsion boiler similar to the one found on many steam ships, including our own ship *TS Kennedy*. </Text>

            <Title>Feed Valves</Title>
            <Text>Three valves are found in the feed line before the boiler.

The *feed check valve* comes first. It is a stop-check valve which is normally left open, but which can be used to regulate the feed water flow to the boiler if necessary. The feed check valve is always fitted with a reach rod or other means to permit it to be manually operated from the boiler control station.

The feed check is followed by the *feed water regulator* which is a pneumatically actuated regulating valve that responds to changes in boiler drum level and steam demand to automatically control the flow of feedwater into the steam drum in order to maintain a constant level half-way up the steam drum.

The final valve of the set is the *feed stop valve*. This valve is provided to permit the feed system to be secured at the boiler when necessary.</Text>

            <Title>Steam Drum</Title>
            <Text>The steam drum is located near the top of the boiler and should normally be half filled with water and the remainder filled with steam. A *gage glass* on the steam drum allows the operator to determine the water level in the boiler. Too little water would be very dangerous, because without water in the boiler the heat of the flames would melt the boiler tubes and destroy the boiler.

Steam is formed in the boiler tubes, and since steam bubbles are less dense than the surrounding liquid water, they float up to the top of the boiler and eventually rise above the surface of the water in the steam drum. If the steam was allowed to build up in the drum, the boiler pressure would quickly rise, and if not relieved by the safety valves, would cause the boiler to explode. The system is designed to remove steam as quickly as it is created, so a properly operated boiler will maintain a constant pressure.</Text>

            <Title>Glossary </Title>
            <Text> Absolute Pressure
:	A term used to describe pressure as measured above a perfect vacuum. The absence of all pressure which would be indicated by 0 pounds per square inch absolute.
:	*Example:* Atmospheric pressure is expressed as 14.7 psia or 0 psig. Any pressure above atmospheric would have 14.7 added onto the gauge reading to obtain absolute pressure.

Air Ejector
:	A component that is used to remove air from a heat exchanger, thereby creating a vacuum or pressure below atmospheric. The air ejector employs a steam driven Venturi to remove air.
:	*Example:* The air ejector employs steam passing across two nozzles to remove air from the condenser. This removal of air in turn allows for a lower pressure which increases engine efficiency.

Atomization
:	A process where a fluid is broken down into a fine spray, perhaps to aid in the process of combustion.
:	*Example:* Fuel oil is delivered to a boiler in a liquid state. In order to improve the combustion of the fuel oil, it must be converted from a liquid into a spray (typically cone shaped), which will increase the surface area of the oil allowing for better combustion of the oil.

Auxiliary Machinery
:	Any system or unit of machinery that supports the main propulsion units or helps support the ship and the crew; for example, pump, evaporator, steering engine, air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment, laundry and galley equipment, and deck winch.

Back Pressure
:	The pressure exerted on the exhaust side of a pump or engine. Synonym for the Auxiliary Exhaust System.

Ballasting
:	The process of filling empty tanks with seawater to protect and maintain the ship's stability.
:	See also deballasting.

:	A method of joining two metals at high temperature with a molten alloy.

Brine
:	A highly concentrated solution of salt in water, normally associated with the overboard discharge of distilling plants.

British Thermal Unit
:	A unit of measure of thermal energy. Used to indicate the amount of heat energy within a substance. One BTU is defined as the "amount of heat energy necessary to raise one pound of water at sea level one degree Fahrenheit."
:	*Example:* A wooden match, which is approximated 3 inches long, would yield one BTU when burned the entire length.

Brittleness
:	A property of a material that causes it to break or snap suddenly with little or no prior sign of deformation.

:	The largest gear in a reduction gear train. The main gear, as in a geared turbine drive.

Bushing
:	A renewable lining for a hole through which a moving part passes.

Bypass
:	A flow path around a component, or an action or process where a component that provides for stable plant operations has to be taken out of service and a manual means is applied in order for the operation of that system to continue.
:	*Example:* The 150 psi reducing station control valve fails. A hand operated bypass valve must be used in order for the system to continue to operate.
:	To divert the flow of gas or liquid from its normal path. Also, the line that diverts the flow. Often used to manually control pressure or flow in the event of automatic regulator failure.

Calibration
:	The adjustment of a measuring instrument to agree with a standard of greater accuracy.

Cantilever
:	A projecting arm or beam supported only at one end.

Capillary Tube
:	A slender, thin-walled, small-bored tube. In instrumentation, it carries a temperature signal from sensor to indicator.

Carbon Packing
:	Pressed segments of graphite used to prevent steam leakage around shafts.

Cavitation
:	A process where a reduction in pressure causes a reduced boiling point and vaporization of a fluid.
:	*Example:* The bubbles formed on the rear of a propeller blade are created due to the reduction in pressure on the backside of the propeller blade. The reduction in pressure causes flashing or vaporizing of the fluid, which forms the bubbles. Cavitations can also be found in pumps due to the reduction in pressure in the eye of the impeller caused by the vortex action of fluid flow in the center of the impeller.

Cross Connected Plant
:	A method of operating two or more systems as one unit.

Cross-Connect
:	An action which allows one system or component to serve more than one role. The second role may be that of providing a duplicate purpose of a pump in case of failure.
:	*Example:* The auxiliary circulating water system can be 'cross connected" to the main condenser to provide cooling to the main condenser in case of failure.

Curtis Stage
:	A velocity-compounded impulse turbine stage that has one pressure drop in the nozzles and two velocity drops in the blading.

Deaerating Feed Tank (DFT) or (DA tank) or (DC Heater)
:	A device used in the waste-heat boiler system to remove dissolved oxygen and non-condensible gases from the feedwater.

            <Title>Centrifugal pumps</Title>
            <Text>Centrifugal pumps use centrifugal force to transfer the mechanical energy supplied to the pump into primarily kinetic energy (velocity) in the fluid being pumped. Centrifugal force is the force generated by rotation which acts outward from the center of rotation. Using the terminology already covered, centrifugal pumps are classified as: *non-positive displacement* pumps, *non-self priming*, and are *constant delivery* for a given operating speed and discharge pressure. Because of their simplicity, low cost and ability to operate under a wide variety of conditions, centrifugal pumps are widely used. They can be adapted to produce any head up to several thousand feet and will handle liquids at temperatures up to 1000° F. They can also be designed to handle liquids containing a high proportion of rather large solid particles.

Fig: pumps/centpump.png "Centrifugal Pump" class=left

A centrifugal pump consists of a rotating element called the *impeller*, which is the only moving part in the pump, and a specially shaped housing, or pump *casing*. In practically all centrifugal pumps, liquid enters the rotating element at the center through the *eye*, and is given a rotary motion in the pump chamber by the rotation of a number of impeller blades (generally called *vanes*). The rotation of the impeller in a true centrifugal pump does two things. Centrifugal force drives the liquid directly out from the center of the impeller, setting up a greater pressure in the chamber at the outer edge of the impeller than at the eye. At the same time the liquid is also pushed around and around by the turning of the vanes, and is given more and more velocity as it moves farther out from the eye. The liquid finally leaves the impeller tangentially at the end of the vanes with a high velocity, and flows into the discharge passage of the pump housing surrounding the impeller.

The discharge passage gradually widens as it leads the liquid away from the impeller to the discharge nozzle on the pump housing. The gradual widening of the discharge passage reduces the velocity of the liquid. Since the reduction in velocity does not produce work, it results in a change in the type of energy contained in the liquid. Most of the velocity (kinetic energy) in the liquid produced by the centrifugal pump is transformed into pressure (potential energy) by the widening discharge passage. This type of energy is more available for doing work. On most centrifugal pumps this widening passage is built into the pump casing that surrounds the impeller and is called the *volute*. Additional conversion of velocity to pressure may be accomplished in the discharge nozzle and sometimes in the piping leading away from the pump.

Recall that a reduction in the velocity of a liquid (without producing any work) changes the type of energy contained in the liquid into increased pressure. The reverse is also true. If the pressure in a liquid is reduced (without producing any work) then the velocity of the liquid must increase.)

When liquid is forced away from the eye by centrifugal force, a reduced pressure area is created in the eye causing more liquid to flow in. This creates a constant flow through the impeller and out through the discharge of the centrifugal pump.

In a centrifugal pump, the velocity that can be imparted to the liquid, and the resulting discharge pressure depends upon both the impeller diameter and the impeller RPM. Increasing either results in:

-   higher centrifugal force
-   higher liquid velocity
-   higher pressure

The centrifugal pump, with a certain size impeller operating at a set speed, will only put enough energy in the liquid to create a specific discharge pressure. If the resistance in the discharge piping rises to the maximum pressure the pump can create, liquid flow through the pump stops. The centrifugal pump is said to be operating at its *shut-off head* and no liquid is delivered by the pump. Friction between the rotating impeller and the liquid trapped in the pump casing increases the liquid temperature, possibly causing it to vaporize. To prevent vaporization of the liquid in a high speed centrifugal pump handling very hot liquids, a small pipeline is installed on the discharge side of the pump to divert a small amount of liquid back to the supply tank on the suction side of the pump. This small quantity of liquid flowing through the pump acts as a cooling system constantly removing the heated liquid from the pump casing and replacing it with cooler liquid from the supply tank. These lines are called *recirculating lines* and are always found on shipboard turbine-driven centrifugal feed pumps because they are frequently subjected to shut-off head when the ship’s main engine is stopped or maneuvering.

Impeller vanes which curve backwards with respect to their direction of rotation are more efficient and give better performance than straight vanes; however, the pump must be turned in the correct direction to obtain this efficiency. The advantage of straight vane impellers is that they have the same efficiency in either direction of pump rotation. In Figref(centpump.png), the impeller rotation is counter-clockwise allowing the liquid to be pushed around the pump chamber by the vanes, rather than being carried by them. If a curved vane impeller was operated in the wrong direction rotation, it would still deliver some liquid, but the following would be observed:

-   The pump would require more power to turn the impellor backwards.
-   The pump discharge capacity would decrease.
-   The pump efficiency would decrease.</Text>

To open a gate valve, the moving part, called the *gate* or *wedge*, is moved across to the fluid flow path unblocking the opening in the valve, called the *seat*. The gate is actually slid off the surface of the seat sideways. Sliding the gate back over the seat blocks fluid flow and closes the valve.

When open, fluids follow a straight, unobstructed path through the valve creating a minimal pressure drop across the valve. This is the principle advantage of a gate valve over a globe valve; it has a much lower restriction to flow when fully open.

Gate valves are designed to be fully open or fully closed. They should not be left partially open to regulate fluid flow. The fluid flow under a partially open gate causes the gate to swing back and forth. This could cause the gate to hit the seats (sometimes called *chattering*) creating damage to the machined surfaces of the seat and gate leading to leakage when the valve is closed.

A gate valve, like a globe valve, is constructed in two basic parts, the body, and the bonnet.

            <Text>Although the term may be unfamiliar to you, you probably know more about *internal energy* than you realize. Because molecules are constantly in motion, they exert a pressure on the walls of the pipe, boiler, cylinder, or other object in which they are contained. Also, the temperature of any substance arises from, and is directly proportional to, the activity of the molecules. Therefore, every time you read thermometers and pressure gages you are finding out something about the amount of internal energy contained in the substance. High pressures and temperatures indicate that the molecules are moving rapidly and that the substance therefore has a lot of internal energy.

For most purposes, we will not need to distinguish between the two stored forms of thermal energy. Therefore, instead of referring to internal potential energy and internal kinetic energy, from now on we will simply use the term “internal energy.” By internal energy, then, we will mean the sum total of all internal energy stored in the substance or system because of the motion of the molecules and because of the forces of attraction between molecules.</Text>

            <Title>Types of Safety Shoes</Title>
            <Text>**Safety Shoes and Boots.** Safety shoes and boots are available in many styles depending on the job requirements. Boots provide more protection than shoes from chemicals and molten metals splashes and spark hazards, but they are heavier. Some protective features that are available in both boots and shoes include:

-   Oil resistant shoes
-   Chemical resistant shoes
-   Heat resistant shoes
-   Slip and skid resistant shoes
-   Waterproof and water resistant shoes

**Steel-Reinforced Safety Shoes and Boots.** Similar to safety shoes, these have the toe box and insole reinforced with steel, and the instep reinforced with steel, aluminum, or plastic. These shoes will protect your feet from falling objects and puncture injuries.

**Electrically Insulated Safety Shoes.** These shoes have non-conductive soles to prevent the wearer’s feet from completing an electrical circuit to ground. They can protect workers against as much as 600 volts in dry conditions. These shoes should be used in conjunction with insulated tools and precautions to reduce or eliminate the potential for providing a path for hazardous electrical energy. Non-conductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations; in such locations, electrically conductive shoes are required.

**Electrically Conductive Safety Shoes.** These shoes protect against the buildup of static electricity. Essentially, these shoes ground the employees wearing them. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on an employee’s body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. During training, employees must be instructed not to use foot powder or wear socks made of silk, wool, or nylon with conductive shoes. Foot powder insulates and retards the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool, and nylon produce static electricity. Conductive shoes are not general-purpose shoes and must be removed upon completion of the tasks for which they are required. Employees exposed to electrical hazards must *never* wear conductive shoes.</Text>

            <Text>Safety glasses are lightweight glasses that have shatter resistant lenses made of materials like polycarbonate or propionate plastic and often have side shields attached to the side pieces. Safety glasses are designed to stop flying objects such as chips, fragments, sand, and dirt from injuring your eyes. They also can provide laser light filtration to prevent reflections from the laser entering the eye and causing retinal burns. Safety glasses can be purchased with prescription lenses including bifocals if necessary.
The main advantage of safety glasses is that they are lightweight and relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The provide little to no protection from liquids or vapors, and some flying particles may get around the side shields.

            <Title>Hearing Protection </Title>
            <Text>Over the years, many marine engineers have suffered permanent hearing loss due to hours of exposure to the high noise levels in the engine room. You can prevent the loss of your own hearing by using proper hearing protection such as earplugs and earmuffs religiously whenever you are exposed to loud noises.

Your ear is a delicate instrument which contains thousands of fine hair cells called cilia to detect sounds. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can injure or break these cells or even tear off groups of these cells. Since the hair cells don’t ever repair themselves, when enough of them are damaged, a hearing loss results.

Short, intense, sounds such as an explosion can cause immediate and permanent hearing loss, but most hearing loss occurs gradually due to prolonged exposure to high noise levels. Most of the time this loss is so gradual that you are not even aware that it is occurring. Hearing loss is progressive and will continue to get worse as you continue to expose yourself to a noisy environment, but if you can avoid further exposure, the hearing loss won’t get any worse.

Permanent hearing loss is not the only hazard associated with noisy environments. Tinnitus is a condition where a ringing or roaring sound is heard continuously in one or both ears. Tinnitus occurs when the hair cells are damaged in such a way that they produce sound signals to the brain even in the absence of actual stimulation. This noise is sometimes described as like having a cricket permanently stuck in your ear, and is very annoying.

Sound intensity is measured in units of *decibels* (dB). The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale in which 0 dB indicates the quietest sound that can be heard by a normal person. A quiet library is about 20 dB. A normal conversation occurs at a sound level of about 60 dB. A lawnmower produces about 85 dB, and at this level you should be wearing hearing protection. Sandblasting or a rock concert has a sound intensity of about 115 dB. At this level hearing damage can occur after only about 15 minutes of unprotected exposure.

According to OSHA regulations, when the 8 hour average noise exposure is above 85 dB, employers are required to institute a noise monitoring program, provide adequate hearing protectors, and ensure employees wear them. Continual, unprotected exposure to noises louder than 85 decibels for 8 hours or more can be dangerous, and may result in hearing loss.

You can easily tell if you should be wearing hearing protection. If you find yourself in a situation where it is too noisy to carry on a conversation at arms length, or if you notice that your ears ring or feel plugged for a time after leaving a noisy environment, you can be sure that you should have been wearing your hearing protection.</Text>

            <Title>Lube Oil System</Title>
            <Text> The main engine is provided with a lubricating oil system which serves three functions: it lubricates the bearings and gears, it cools the bearings and gears, and it provides an actuating medium for the main engine throttles and governors. A schematic diagram of the lube oil system is shown in Figref(lubeoilsystem.png).

The system illustrated is known as a *pressure-gravity* forced lube oil system. In the arrangement, a lubricating oil pump takes suction from the lube oil sump through a suction strainer, and discharges the majority of the oil to the main engine lube oil manifold, where it lubricates the high and low pressure turbine bearings, the reduction gear bearings, the main engine thrust bearing, and the reduction gear teeth. The remainder of the pump discharge flows up into the gravity tank through a small bypass line around the check valve at the bottom of the tank. Under normal circumstances, the gravity tank fills to the top and then overflows into a funnel and back to the main sump. A sight glass, or *bull's eye* in the overflow line allows the watch engineer to observe the overflow and to verify that the gravity tank is full. In the event of lube oil pump failure, the oil stored in the gravity tank will flow out through the check valve and supply the main engine with lubrication for several minutes, long enough to safely secure the turbines before the gravity tank empties and turbine damage occurs.

Two saltwater cooled oil heat exchangers along with a pneumatically controlled bypass valve are provided to maintain the correct oil temperature to the engine. Lubricating oil should be maintained between 90° and 110° F. When first starting up the engine, it is often necessary to heat the oil in the sump to reach the minimum operating temperature. A steam heating connection in the gravity tank is provided for this reason. The oil pressure in the lube oil coolers should be maintained above the sea water pressure, to avoid contamination of the oil in the event of a tube leak.

The main lube oil system has two pumps, one electrically driven, and the other steam driven. The steam pump serves as a backup, and is designed to start automatically whenever the main pump fails to supply sufficient lube oil pressure. Oil from the operating pump discharge is sent directly to the main engine governor, and a loss of oil pressure will initiate an immediate shut down of the main engine. The pump discharge pressure is reduced with an orifice before entering the coolers, and further reduced with a pneumatic unloading valve before reaching the bearings.

In addition to the equipment shown in Figref(lubeoilsystem.png), the system is equipped with relief valves on the pump discharges, bypasses around the regulating valves, thermometers and pressure gages as necessary to monitor the system, and an oil pressure sensor to trigger a low oil pressure alarm at the main console. The system is also interconnected with the lube oil purification and transfer system, where spare lube oil is stored and active oil is cleaned. A centrifugal lube oil purifier in this system is normally used continuously on the oil in the sump, because clean and moisture free lube oil is critical for proper lubrication of the main engine.

In this design, the disk or ball is not attached to any arm or stem. Since the disk is free to move away from the seat without an arm or stem to guide it back in correct alignment to the seat upon closing, other guidance means are employed. In most lift check valves, the disk (with higher than normal sides) or the ball just fits into to hole in the upper part of the body. When flow pushes the disk or ball away from the seat, the walls of the hole in the upper body guide the disk or ball straight up away from the seat. These walls also guide the disk straight down when it is closing assuring correct alignment between the disk and seat for tight closure.</Text>

**Disposable foam plugs.** Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each person’s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better.

**Reusable, pre-molded plugs.** Pre-molded plugs are made from silicone, plastic or rubber and are manufactured as either “one-size-fits-most” or are available in several sizes. Be sure to choose the proper size for your ear canals. In some cases, different size plugs may be required for each ear. The advantage of pre-molded plugs are that they are inexpensive, reusable, washable, convenient to carry, and come in a variety of sizes. Nearly everyone can find a plug that will be comfortable and effective. Another advantage is that in a dirty environment like the engine room, you don’t need to handle or roll the tips. You insert this type of plug by reaching over your head with one hand to pull up on your ear. Then use your other hand to insert the plug with a gentle rocking motion until you have sealed the ear canal.

**Hearing Bands.** Hearing Bands, also called canal caps or semi-insert devices often resemble earplugs on a flexible plastic or metal band. The earplug tips of a canal cap may be a formable or pre-molded material. Some have headbands that can be worn over the head, behind the neck or under the chin. The main advantage of canal caps is their convenience They are easy to put on and take off . When it’s quiet, employees can leave the band hanging around their necks, but they can quickly insert the plug tips when hazardous noise starts again. These devices are ideal for intermittent use, but they provide less protection then either plugs or muffs. Some people find the pressure from the bands uncomfortable.

&gt;**What is a Decibel?**

&gt;The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first let’s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power *P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*, and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power *P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*, but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* dB where the log is to base 10. If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 2 = 3 dB. If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 10 = 10 dB. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be 10 log *(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)* = 10 log 1,000,000 = 60 dB. This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size.

&gt;Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, *p*. The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of *x* is just 2 log *x*, this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with *p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*and *p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* is defined as: 20 log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) dB where the log is to base 10. This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. (This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers (Walkmans) are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries.) So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that 20 log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) = 86 dB where *p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;* is the sound pressure of the reference level, and *p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: log (*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*) = 4.3 dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long.

&gt;What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level = 20 log (*p*&lt;sub&gt;measured&lt;/sub&gt; /*p*&lt;sub&gt;reference&lt;/sub&gt; ) = 20 log 1 = 0 dB. So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals.</Text>

            <Title>Suction Head</Title>
            <Text>The distance between the surface of the liquid in the supply tank and the centerline of the pump suction describes the pump *suction head*.

*Positive suction head*, also called *gravity head*, occurs when the liquid level in the supply tank is *above* the center of the pump suction. The height of the liquid creates a pressure on the suction side of the pump that is greater than atmospheric pressure, and gravity causes the liquid to flow into the pump suction. In this situation, very little power is required to draw the liquid into the pump.

*Negative suction head*, also called *suction lift*, occurs when the liquid level in the supply tank is *below* the center of the pump suction. In this case, the pump must create the force necessary to lift the liquid uphill against the force of gravity and draw it into the pump suction. This process obviously requires more pumping power than when there is a positive suction head.

To pump when there is a suction lift, we use the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the liquid in the supply tank to push the liquid up the pipe to the pump suction, much like sucking on a straw. If the pressure inside the suction pipe is reduced to 13.7 psia compared to the 14.7 psia on the surface of the water in the supply tank, than the water level in the suction pipe should be 2.31 feet higher than the water level in the supply tank. (remember: 1 psi = 2.31 feet of fresh water!). Now if the pressure in the suction pipe is lowered to 0 psia, the atmospheric pressure should theoretically push the water up against the force of gravity (14.7 x 2.31 = 33.96 feet) 34 feet inside the suction pipe. The suction side of the pump will be operating at a pressure lower than atmospheric (under a vacuum) when the pump is lifting. 34 feet of suction lift is the theoretical maximum for fresh water, but in the real world, the maximum suction lift is less.</Text>

            <Title>Cleaning Burners</Title>
            <Text>As the boiler is operated, the burner tips tend to get clogged with deposits of unburned fuel oil. Once each day the burners must be removed from the boiler and cleaned. The burner is removed and allowed to cool, then the tip is removed and soaked in a burner cleaning solution to loosen up the deposits. After soaking, the remaining deposits are removed by scraping with a brass or copper implement. Soft metal tools are used to avoid damaging the tip and holes. Finally the burner is reassembled, inspected and placed back into service. Be aware that the burner cleaning solution, called *carbon remover*, will cause chemical burns of your skin and eyes. Always use caution, and wear proper protective gear such as rubber gloves and a face shield, when working with carbon remover.</Text>

Obviously, fresh sour oranges are best, but what’s better: the marinade or the mixture of fresh orange and lime juice? I used the marinade to make your cochinita pibil recipe and it turned out really well, but I’m wondering now if using the fresh juice would have made it even better.

            <Title>Monitoring the Boiler</Title>
            <Text>Watchstanders must continuously monitor the boiler while it is in operation to prevent small problems from becoming big problems. Most of the time, the boiler automation system works correctly and the boiler seems to take care of itself, but it only takes a small problem and a few minutes of inattention before you have a serious casualty: the boiler can overheat and melt, over-pressurize and lift safety valves, or even explode! During a boiler casualty, time is critical; the sooner a problem is detected, the easier it is to take care of. Ideally, the engineer should notice the symptoms developing and respond, long before it gets serious – even before an alarm rings. Of course, the licensed watch engineer has the primary responsibility for the safe operation of the boiler, but even a youngie can become a hero by noticing something wrong, and bringing it to his attention in time to save the plant!

In this section, we will discuss the boiler parameters that you should watch whenever you’re in the engine room, and especially whenever you’re on watch in the control room or the fire room.</Text>

            <Text>The National Safety Council has found that hands are the body part most frequently injured on the job. Accidents to the hand fall into these categories: abrasions, cuts, punctures, crushes, contact with moving machinery, burns, and chemical injuries. Gloves and hand protection are available to protect you from nearly all of these hazards. However, glove selection must be based on performance characteristics of the gloves, conditions, durations of use, and hazards present. One type of glove will not work in all situations.

In the engine room, particular hazards include high temperatures and moving machinery. Long sleeved shirts are advisable to protect your arms, and you should always have a pair of work gloves available to use when necessary to protect your hands when working around hot pipes. Special high temperature gloves should always be worn when changing burners, and the appropriate chemical resistant gloves should be worn when working with burner cleaning and boiler chemicals. You should also pay particular attention to avoid contact with moving parts of machinery or power tools with moving parts, and insure that safety guards are always in place. Gloves should always be inspected for damage before use.</Text>

            <Title>Types of Safety Shoes</Title>
            <Text>**Safety Shoes and Boots.** Safety shoes and boots are available in many styles depending on the job requirements. Boots provide more protection than shoes from chemicals and molten metals splashes and spark hazards, but they are heavier. Some protective features that are available in both boots and shoes include:

-   Oil resistant shoes
-   Chemical resistant shoes
-   Heat resistant shoes
-   Slip and skid resistant shoes
-   Waterproof and water resistant shoes

**Steel-Reinforced Safety Shoes and Boots.** Similar to safety shoes, these have the toe box and insole reinforced with steel, and the instep reinforced with steel, aluminum, or plastic. These shoes will protect your feet from falling objects and puncture injuries.

**Electrically Insulated Safety Shoes.** These shoes have non-conductive soles to prevent the wearer’s feet from completing an electrical circuit to ground. They can protect workers against as much as 600 volts in dry conditions. These shoes should be used in conjunction with insulated tools and precautions to reduce or eliminate the potential for providing a path for hazardous electrical energy. Non-conductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations; in such locations, electrically conductive shoes are required.

**Electrically Conductive Safety Shoes.** These shoes protect against the buildup of static electricity. Essentially, these shoes ground the employees wearing them. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on an employee’s body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. During training, employees must be instructed not to use foot powder or wear socks made of silk, wool, or nylon with conductive shoes. Foot powder insulates and retards the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool, and nylon produce static electricity. Conductive shoes are not general-purpose shoes and must be removed upon completion of the tasks for which they are required. Employees exposed to electrical hazards must *never* wear conductive shoes.</Text>

            <Title>Overspeed Protection</Title>
            <Text>An overspeed governor oil pump is mounted at the forward end of each turbine rotor. These pumps supply oil under pressure to the overspeed sensing pistons in the maneuvering valve. The pump impellers are supplied with oil from the bearing lubrication lines. The oil pressure developed by each pump increases with increasing turbine speed. When the pressure increases to a value corresponding to 108% of the maximum rated speed, the sensing piston on the maneuvering valve causes a pilot valve to open and drain oil from the operating piston to close the ahead throttle valve. When the turbine speed returns to normal, the ahead valve opens again. The sensing pistons can be operated manually and independently to simulate an overspeed condition on either turbine.</Text>

            <Title>Electrical Shock</Title>
            <Text>The most immediate and dangerous hazard of electricity is electrical shock. When a person comes into contact with an electrical current, it can pass through their body, causing electrical shock. Even low-voltage shocks can lead to muscle contractions, burns, and disruption of the body's electrical signals. High-voltage shocks can result in severe burns, organ damage, and cardiac arrest.

            <Text>Fig: turbines/jackinggear.png "Jacking Gear"class=left 

The turning gear, or *Jacking Gear,* Figref(jackinggear.png), is an electric motor which is used to turn the rotor at a slow speed, one revolution every five to ten minutes, during start-up and shut down periods to prevent damage to the turbine rotor and interstage seals. The turning gear can also be used to rotate the gears to facilitate inspection of the gear teeth, and can be used to lock the gears and shaft in position for lay-up or towing.

Turbine rotors will warp and rub the stationary casing if they are allowed to heat or cool unevenly. This warping is caused by the uneven temperature distribution from top to bottom in the turbine casing. The temperature is highest at the top, and coolest at the bottom near the cool condenser tubes. Thermal expansion due to this temperature gradient will cause the turbine to bow upward if the turbine is allowed to stand stationary for too long. When warming up and cooling down the main engine, the turning gear is used to slowly rotate the turbine shaft to maintain the rotor at a uniform temperature throughout. When maneuvering, the propeller may be stopped by the captain or pilot for long periods of time; under these circumstances, the rotor must be periodically rotated with a blast of steam from the throttles for the same reason.

The turning gear can be manually engaged or disengaged using a mechanical clutch. It is critical that steam never be admitted to the engine at any time while the jacking gear is engaged as this would result in severe damage to the bearings and gears.</Text>

            <Title>Steam Drum [steamdrum2]</Title>
            <Text>The steam drum, Figref(steamdrum.png), is a cylindrical steel vessel located near the top of the boiler. It serves two purposes: it is an upper reservoir for the water in the boiler, and it is the point where the steam is separated from the water. The normal steam/water interface is located half way up the steam drum, and visible to the operator through the *boiler gage glass*. It is critical that a water level be maintained in the steam drum at all times when the boiler is operating. Without sufficient water in the boiler, the heat of the furnace would melt the boiler tubes and disable the boiler. One of the engineer's most critical duties is to maintain the water level in the boiler at all times. 

Fig: boilers/steamdrum.png "Steam Drum Internals" class=right 

The lower portion of the steam drum, where it is perforated by the boiler tubes is thicker than the upper section, for strength. The lower portion is called the *tube sheet*, and the upper portion is called the *wrapper sheet*. The ends of the steam drum are known as the *heads*, and one of the heads is fitted with a *manhole*, to allow access to the inside of the drum for inspection or repair.

The top of the steam drum is fitted with an air cock, which is simply a pipe terminated with two valves. When the valves are open, the boiler steam drum pressure can equalize with the atmosphere. The air cock is opened when the boiler is first lit off. As the steam begins to form, it is allowed to blow out the air cock, expelling any air which has collected in the drum. After the steam pressure has built up to 20-30 psi and all air is expelled, the air cock is closed to seal the drum. It remains closed at all times while the boiler is operating, and is not opened again until the boiler is secured. After the fires are extinguished and as the boiler begins to cool down, the air cock must be reopened again at about 50 psi. Otherwise, the condensing steam in the steam drum will create a vacuum there, breaking the seal at the boiler hand-hole gaskets, which are primarily designed to seal against internal, not external, pressure.

A *steam drum safety valve* is also located on top of the steam drum. This valve is adjusted to open automatically if the steam drum pressure rises too high. This can protect the boiler from exploding, and the noise of the steam flowing through should alert the engineer that something is seriously wrong. If you ever hear a boiler safety valve blowing off steam, your first action as an engineer should be to secure the fires, to prevent additional steam from being generated, until you know what is causing the problem.

Inside the steam drum you will find several internal fittings. These fittings help distribute water evenly throughout the drum, separate the generated steam from the water, and remove moisture from the steam before it leaves the boiler. The *dry pipe* is a perforated tube located at the top of the steam drum. As steam is formed and rises to the top of the boiler, it enters the dry pipe and from there it is removed from the steam drum. It is important that no moisture enter the dry pipe, because water droplets in the steam would damage the turbines downstream, so modern boilers include *cyclone steam separators* which help to remove moisture from the steam by causing it to spin rapidly around a spiral path as it moves upward. The centrifugal force throws the heavier water droplets to the separator walls, where it drains back to the drum. Only dry steam should make it through the separator. A *chemical feed pipe* is provided to distribute boiler chemicals throughout the steam drum. Another perforated pipe known as the *internal feed pipe* is located below the water level and is used to distribute the incoming feedwater evenly throughout the steam drum. The *surface blow pipe* is another perforated pipe located below the water level and connected overboard. Opening the *surface blow valve* allows boiler water to discharge over the side. This is done to rid the boiler of contaminants such as suspended solids, oil and excess boiler chemicals, and in emergencies to lower the boiler water level quickly.

You may also find a *submerged tube desuperheater* in the steam drum. This is a pipe which makes several passes underneath the surface of the water in the steam drum. Superheated steam is passed through this pipe, where it cools down to near its saturation temperature. Internal desuperheaters like this are used for two purposes. Most commonly, they are used to provide desuperheated steam for auxiliary systems which are not designed to operate on high temperature superheated steam. Other desuperheaters are used to reduce and control the temperature of the main superheated steam by blending the hot superheated steam with cooler desuperheated steam; this type is called a *control desuperheater.*</Text>

            <Title>Rotary Pumps</Title>
            <Text>All the many varieties of rotary pumps operate on the same principle. An element called the *rotor* is rotated in the pump chamber in such a way that the liquid is carried or pushed from the suction side of the pump to the discharge side.

Rotary pumps are positive displacement, since they deliver a fixed quantity of liquid for each operational cycle or revolution of the pump shaft. This means that they want to move liquid even when the pump discharge is blocked. If the discharge of a rotary pump were closed with the pump operating, and if no pressure relief valve was installed in the pump discharge line, pressure would build up till the shaft seal failed, the electric motor overloaded and stopped, the engine driving the pump stalled, the pump casing or discharge piping ruptured, or some other casualty resulted.

When a rotary pump is operating at a constant speed, the amount of liquid delivered to the discharge line decreases slightly as the discharge pressure working against the pump increases. The drop in discharge capacity is due to increased internal leakage through the close clearances between stationary and moving parts in the pump housing. As the discharge pressure increases, the leakage rate from the discharge to the suction side of the pump, through the internal clearances, increases. This internal leakage reduces the pump’s discharge capacity, and is known as *slip.*

There are dozens of designs for the rotors of rotary pumps. Gears may be used as in Figref(gear_pump.png), but with almost any number of teeth, and in a variety of forms; elements that look like gears may be employed, although one of the pair may not be capable of rotating the other; two, three, or more lobes may be used; screws may be used which carry the liquid through the pump in their hollowed-out channels; sliding or swinging vanes may be used which form a seal with the walls of the chamber because they are pushed from the center of the rotor by mechanical arrangements or are thrown out by centrifugal force; small pistons moving in and out from the center of the rotor may be used to push liquid through the pump; and there are still more varieties. A few representative designs of rotary pumps will be described in the following sections.</Text>

            <Title>Pressure Relief Valves</Title>
            <Text> Relief valves are protective devices designed to open automatically when the pressure in the line unit becomes too high. Although there are different types of relief valves, the most common type has a disk that is held in the closed position by a coil spring. When the pressure in the line or machine creates a force great enough to overcome the spring force, the disk moves upward and is opened. After the pressure has been relieved by the escape of fluid through the relief valve, the spring again exerts enough force to close the disk. 

Fig: valves/crosbyHSJ.png "Relief Valve" class=right

Relief valves have no hand-wheel operator, but may be equipped with a lever attached to the valve stem which the operator can use to momentarily open the valve, in order to test that the valve can open properly, or to blow out debris such as rust or dirt, which if lodged between the disk and seat would cause the valve to leak.

Relief valves are designed to work properly with any type of fluid, while safety valves are only designed to work with gases.

Most relief valves are set to open when the pressure against the disk reaches 110% of the *Maximum Allowable Working Pressure* (called the MAWP) of the system or machine. For example, if a system operates with a MAWP of 100 psi, then the relief valve would open at 110 psi.

Relief valves are designed to close at a pressure lower than their opening pressure (The difference between opening and closing pressure is called *blowdown*). This is done to prevent *valve chattering*, which is a rapid opening and closing of the valve. Chattering is undesirable because it can damage the seat and disk. If the valve opened and closed at exactly the same pressure, it would chatter, because as soon as it opened, the pressure would drop and cause the valve to close, and as soon as it closed the pressure would cause it to open again.

Chattering is prevented by exposing an additional disk surface area to the fluid pressure immediately after the valve opens. This increased area, acted upon by the fluid pressure, increases the force against the spring, and makes the valve open rapidly once it starts to open, but it will not close again until the pressure falls significantly below the opening pressure.

It must be remembered that the coil spring force acting when the valve begins to open is the same as the spring force acting when the valve closes. Since \\( F = PA \\):

\\[P_o A_o = P_c A_c\\]

Where:

-   \\(P_o\\) is Opening pressure.
-   \\(P_c\\) is Closing pressure.
-   \\(A_o\\) is Opening area.
-   \\(A_c\\) is Closing area.

Remember, the extra surface area is not available until the valve disk opens.

**Example 3.2. Relief Valve Problem**

A relief valve opens at 250 psi and has a bottom surface area when closed of 0.75 in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. When the valve opens, the bottom surface area increases by 10%. What pressure does the valve close at?

**Solution**

\\[\begin{align*}

            <Title>Tubes and headers</Title>
            <Text>The boiler tubes connect the steam drum to the water drum, roughly in the shape of a letter "D." A boiler may contain perhaps 2000 tubes, most of which are considered *generating tubes*, where the majority of the steam produced by the boiler is formed. As the steam formed in the generating tubes rises up to the steam drum, it must be replaced with cooler water from the steam drum. This water is carried down through tubes located in cooler areas of the boiler, known as *downcomers*. A typical generating tube would be about 1 to 1½ inch diameter, while the downcomers are larger; 3 to 11 inches in diameter.

The roof, rear, and side *waterwall tubes* run up the sides and ceiling in the furnace area to protect the furnace walls from too much heat. These tubes normally act as downcomers, carrying water from the steam drum down to the water drum, but at high firing rates may act as generating tubes. Since waterwall tubes absorb the heat of the furnace, less refractory material is required to insulate the boiler, which reduces the total boiler weight.

The first few rows of tubes in the gas path are known as *Screen tubes*. Their location between the burner flames and the *superheater tubes* protects the *superheater* from the direct radiant heat of the flame.

*Headers* are circular or square pressure vessels, used to distribute water to the boiler tubes. The *side wall* and *rear wall* headers are supplied with water from a downcomer, and distribute it to the side and rear wall tubes, and in some boiler designs, a *screen tube* header distributes water to the screen tubes. Sludge accumulates in the headers, and they must be blown down periodically like the water drum.</Text>

            <Title>Valves</Title>
            <Text>In general, a valve is a device installed in a piping system to control the amount, direction or pressure of the contained fluid flowing through the pipe lines. Most valves control fluid flow with a carefully designed moving part which can fully open, partially open (called *throttling*), or close an opening called an *orifice* inside the valve. Since the valve must stop all fluid flow when it is closed, the surface of the moving part that covers the opening and the surface surrounding the stationary opening must be precisely machined and fitted. In many valves, both these surfaces are metal and they must seal tightly against one another without the aid of gaskets or seals between them.

Various valves use one of four basic means of controlling flow:

-   a moving disk or plug blocking orifice;
-   sliding a flat, cylindrical or spherical surface across an orifice;
-   rotating a disk across the diameter of piping;
-   or, moving a flexible material into the flow path.

The movable part inside the valve has its position controlled by a shaft or valve stem that passes through the valve body to the outside. The valve stem is rotated or moved axially depending on the valve design by one or a combination of the following methods:

-   Manually using a hand-wheel or lever
-   Electrically using electro-magnets (solenoids) or motors
-   Pneumatically using compressed air to move a piston or air motor
-   Hydraulically using pressurized oil to move a piston or hydraulic     motor

In marine service, manually operated valves fitted with hand-wheels (with operator facing the side of the hand-wheel opposite the valve stem) are required to open by rotating the hand-wheel in the counter-clockwise direction and close when the hand-wheel is rotated in the clockwise direction. Most hand-wheel operated valves in use in other applications open and close in the same manner.

Several different types of valves are shown in Figref(valvetypes.png). Of these, the most important types for shipboard use - globe, gate, check, plug, ball, butterfly, and relief - will be discussed in this chapter.

            <Title>Fire </Title>
            <Text>Fire aboard ship is an ever-present threat that can swiftly escalate into a catastrophic disaster. With limited means of escape, a ship becomes a confined space where flames can spread rapidly, fueled by combustible materials and confined by its structure. 
The close quarters, complex layout, and intricate ventilation systems aboard ship create formidable challenges for the ship’s small firefighting team. In addition to the immediate threat to human lives, a shipboard fire poses a significant risk to the environment, as toxic smoke, potential oil spills, and the release of hazardous substances can wreak havoc on marine ecosystems. 
Effective fire prevention measures, comprehensive emergency response plans, rigorous training, and state-of-the-art firefighting equipment are crucial in mitigating this threat and ensuring the safety of everyone on board.
Fire prevention measures play a vital role in minimizing the risk of fire and maintaining a safe environment aboard ship. These measures encompass a range of proactive strategies aimed at preventing fires from starting or spreading. One fundamental aspect is implementing rigorous safety protocols and adhering to international standards, such as the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) regulations for fire safety.
Some key fire prevention measures include:
&lt;ul&gt;
 Regular Inspections and Maintenance. Conducting routine inspections of electrical systems, machinery, and fire suppression equipment is crucial. Identifying and addressing potential hazards, faulty wiring, or malfunctioning equipment can prevent fire incidents.
 Training and Education. Crew members should receive comprehensive training on fire safety, including proper handling of flammable substances, effective use of firefighting equipment, and emergency response procedures. Increasing awareness and knowledge among the crew can significantly reduce the likelihood of fire-related accidents.
 Fire Detection Systems. Installing advanced fire detection systems, such as smoke detectors, heat sensors, and flame detectors, helps in early detection of fires. These systems can trigger alarms, alerting the crew and initiating immediate response actions.
 Fire Suppression Systems. Equipping ships with reliable fire suppression systems, such as fixed CO2 or water mist systems, can effectively control and extinguish fires. These systems are designed to release the appropriate extinguishing agent in the affected area, limiting the fire's spread.
 Proper Storage and Handling. Storing flammable materials in designated areas and following strict protocols for their handling reduces the risk of accidental ignition. Implementing proper waste management procedures and ensuring the availability of suitable fire-resistant containers also contribute to fire prevention efforts.
 Structural Fire Protection. Regulations require fire-resistant materials and insulation in the ship's construction helps to contain fires and slow down their progression. Fire-resistant doors, bulkheads, and insulation compartmentalize the vessel, preventing the rapid spread of flames.
 Emergency Preparedness. Developing and regularly reviewing comprehensive emergency response plans specific to fire incidents is crucial. This includes establishing evacuation procedures, assigning roles and responsibilities to crew members, and conducting fire drills to ensure everyone knows how to respond swiftly and effectively in an emergency.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
By implementing robust fire prevention measures, ships can significantly reduce the risk of fire, enhance the crew's safety, and protect the marine environment from potential devastation.</Text>

            <Text>In a swing check valve, Figref(Checkvalve_views.png)(A), the valve seat is angled 45° to the fluid flow path through the valve. The disk is attached by an arm to a hinge pin inside the valve body near the cover opening. The hinge pin is located just above the highest part of the seat opening. When the fluid flow is from right to left and the pressure on the bottom of the disk is greater than the pressure on the top of the disk, the disk swings away from the seat allowing flow to take place. When fluid flow tries to reverse (from left to right), the pressure on top of the disk becomes greater than the pressure on the bottom of the disk, the disk to moves back toward the seat, preventing flow in this direction. The arm and hinge pin assembly assure correct alignment between the disk and seat for a tight closure.</Text>

            <Title>Personal Protective Equipment</Title>
            <Text>Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and other work accessories designed to create a barrier against workplace hazards. It provides an important link in the chain of workplace safety, but PPE alone is not a substitute for safe engineering design, proper training, good work practices, safety awareness, or hazard reduction. All these elements together are required to minimize the danger of workplace hazards and maximize the safety and health of workers.

Using personal protective equipment requires hazard awareness and training on the part of the user. You must be trained to know when personal protective equipment is necessary, what type is necessary, how it is to be worn, and what its limitations are, as well as know its proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal. In addition, you must be aware that the equipment does not eliminate the hazard. If the equipment fails, you can be injured. To reduce the possibility of failure, equipment must be properly fitted, and maintained in a clean and serviceable condition.

To protect yourself, you must be wearing the proper personal protective when it is needed and recognize its limitations. The equipment must not be altered or removed even though you may find it uncomfortable. In some cases however, the equipment may be uncomfortable because it does not fit properly.

In this chapter we will discuss some of the personal protective equipment normally found and used aboard ship.</Text>

            <Title>Superheater</Title>
            <Text>When water boils, it occurs at a particular temperature which is determined by the pressure of the surroundings. For example, water at atmospheric pressure always boils at 212 °F, while water at 600 psia always boils at 486 °F. This boiling temperature is known as the *saturation temperature* and it can easily be determined from the steam tables found in [](#steamtables). At a given pressure, the steam’s temperature can be raised above the corresponding saturation temperature by adding additional heat to the steam, but this must occur in an area where there is no liquid water present, or the additional heat would simply boil more water and would not raise the steam temperature at all. Raising steam temperature above the saturation temperature is known as *superheating* and the *degree of superheat* refers to the difference between the steam temperature and the saturation temperature corresponding to the steam’s pressure. For example, 600 psia, 600 °F steam would have 114 degrees of superheat, since it is 114 degrees above the corresponding saturation temperature.

In marine boilers, superheating occurs in the *superheater*. The superheater is a series of boiler tubes located in the hottest part of the gas path, but screened from the radiant heat of the furnace behind three or more rows of *screen tubes*. Heat is added to the superheater primarily by convection. The superheater tubes and headers may be installed either horizontally or vertically.

All the steam formed in the generating tubes rises up to the steam drum and flows into the dry pipe, and from there the steam, which is dry and at saturation temperature, enters the superheater header and is distributed to the superheater tubes. There, the steam picks up sensible heat, which increases the energy content of the steam, improving the overall steam cycle efficiency and reducing fuel consumption. The steam leaves the boiler at the superheater outlet. At the outlet you will find a *superheater vent* and a *superheater safety valve* followed by the main and turbogenerator steam stop valves.

The degree of superheat created in the superheater is determined by several factors, including the temperature of the feedwater, the load on the boiler, and the number and location of burners in use. These factors are not adjustable by the engineer, so the superheater outlet temperature is not under his direct control. A boiler of this type is known as an*uncontrolled superheat* boiler. Other boiler designs provide a means to control the superheat temperature independent of the above factors, and are known as *controlled superheat* boilers.

The superheater elements are normally filled entirely with steam, not water. Since no boiling occurs there, all the heat transferred to the superheater tubes must be carried away by the steam flowing through the tubes, or else they will quickly overheat and burn out, destroying the boiler. Whenever there is a fire in the boiler and no steam flow leaving the boiler, the superheater vent must be opened manually by the engineer to protect the superheater from overheating.</Text>

            <Title>Personal Survival Equipment</Title>
            <Text>A ship or boat has many of the same hazards found in shoreside workplaces, but in addition it has the danger of drowning. Fortunately, ships are equipped with several specialized pieces of safety equipment designed to help protect you in the watery environment. These include: life preservers, work vests, immersion suits, and thermal protective aids.

Fig: ppe/pfdti.png "Type I PFD"class=left

The main function of any PFD, of course, is to keep a person afloat, or buoyant-even with heavy clothes and gear. Its buoyancy also helps a stranded person save energy, because without a PFD a swimmer has to continually work to stay afloat. Some designs also help keep a victim’s face out of the water. A PFD’s buoyancy is the amount of weight it can keep afloat. High buoyancy is over 20 pounds. This may sound low, but water provides lift, so the average adult needs only 7 to 12 pounds of buoyancy.

A PFD can only save your life if it is available when you need it, and you wear it properly. Be sure you know where you keep your own life preserver and also where the spare PFD’s are stowed in the engine room. Use the opportunity at weekly boat drills to practice donning your life jacket, and inspect it frequently for tears and open seams; for lost buoyant material; for waterlogged, oil-soaked, or hardened buoyant material; and for proper functioning of the light and whistle.

**Type I life preserver.** This it the type of life preserver which is used by all hands aboard merchant ships. Every cadet is given instruction in its use during *STCW Basic Safety Training* during orientation.

The Type I life preserver is an international orange colored vest filled with a sufficient amount of inherently buoyant material to give it 22 pounds of buoyancy, and fitted with straps to hold it in position on the wearer. The PFD is equipped with a whistle for attracting attention, and reflective tape and a light to make it more visible at night. Because of its high buoyancy, it is bulky and not normally worn continuously while working.

**Type V PFD Work Vest.** This is a “one size fits all” work vest which provides basic flotation for workers who fall in the water. It is intended for people working in exposed locations over the water or near the edge of the deck, and also for deck crews on tugs and barges. It is assumed that rescue will occur quickly. A work vest is only approved for use consistent with its design.

The main advantage of a work vest is that is has relatively little bulk and does not significantly restrict the wearers movement, making it suitable for continuous wear. It is less buoyant than a Type I PFD and will not hold an unconscious wearer’s face clear of the water. Because it has less buoyancy a conscious wearer’s face may also be covered by waves in rough water.

**Immersion Suit.** Immersion suits, also known as survival suits or “gumby suits,” are a full body, insulated flotation device which can protect you from hypothermia and prevent you from drowning. Because hypothermia is a major factor in lives lost at sea, the U.S. Coast Guard now requires immersion suits on all documented vessels operating north of 32 degrees N and seaward of the Coastal Boundary Line.

Fig: ppe/gumby.png "Immersion Suit" class=right

Hypothermia, the lowering of a person’s core body temperature, can quickly kill anyone who ends up in the water for too long. A person’s survival time in the water depends on several factors including water temperature, the person’s body mass and build, and the insulating properties of his garments. Unprotected, a person will rapidly lose heat in cold water and can die in a matter of minutes. The insulated immersion suit can significantly improve survival time by reducing body heat loss to the water.

A typical immersion suit is made of bright international orange neoprene of sufficient buoyancy to keep you afloat, with a full-length zipper, face seal and flap, integral boots and mittens, and an inflatable head support. The Coast Guard requires all suits to be marked with 31 square inches of retro-reflective tape which improves your visibility and chances of being picked up. A whistle and strobe light are also required on ocean going vessels. Suits must be equipped with a Coast Guard Approved light which should be attached to the shoulder area. Suits must also be marked in “block capital letters” with the vessel name, and the name of the owner of the suit or the name of the person to whom the suit is assigned.

Proper care and maintenance of immersion suits will extend their working life and possibly your own. Routine suit inspections should include suit material and function of zippers and inflation hoses. Inspect for holes, tears or signs of wear. Suits used in salt water or in pools should be rinsed thoroughly inside and out with fresh water and turned inside out to dry, but not in direct sunlight. Grease and oil should be removed from suits with mild soap. Do not dry clean. Check all zippers for smooth operation. Lubricate zippers with a non-petroleum based product such as canning paraffin, beeswax or substance recommended by the manufacturer. Air bladders provide extra buoyancy and are vitally important in keeping the head out of water when lying horizontally in the water. At least once a year the bladder and inflation hose should be checked.

Store your suit in an accessible and dry place. Suits should be rolled and stowed in their bags with the zippers open and zipped up one inch from the bottom. Lubricate snaps and zippers on the bag.

Your immersion suit works properly only when you are wearing it in the water. Safety regulations for documented vessels that operate beyond the boundary lines or with more than 16 people, require monthly drills and instructions for donning immersion suits. First attempts can be awkward and exhausting but with practice you should succeed in getting into a suit in one minute or less. Practice seated donning of suit. This will be the most convenient methods in an actual high sea, emergency situation.


The following are the instructions for practice seated donning of an immersion suit:

1.  Roll suit out on deck and sit on it. Insert your legs into suit     using plastic bags to make it easier. Leave on boots and other     clothing for insulation and protection in the water.

2.  Place non-dominant arm into suit first (lefties-right and     righties-left). Pull hood over head with free hand.

3.  Place dominant arm in last. Pull the zipper up with care and secure     flap over your face.

4.  Make sure that all straps and hoses are secure to avoid being     snagged or injured. Do not inflate air bladder until you are in the     water.

**Thermal Protective Aids (TPA).** The Thermal Protective Aid (TPA) is an indispensable piece of survival gear. The TPA is a windproof, waterproof sack with arms and a hood, made of aluminized polyethylene similar to a space blanket. It is colored bright international orange, with reflective strips to make the it highly visible in all weather conditions. All SOLAS liferafts are required to carry enough TPAs for 10% of the rated crew capacity of the liferaft, or at least two per liferaft.

Fig: ppe/tpa.png "Thermal Protective Aid" width=300px

When worn, the TPA will protect you from exposure and low temperatures. Although it is not as effective as an immersion suit and provides no flotation, it is easy to don, compact to store, and its space blanket effect can prevent hypothermia by cutting down your heat loss from radiation and convection. Unfortunately, if you are immersed in the water, the suit will provide little insulation to heat loss by conduction, but it can save your life if you can get out of the water. </Text>

            <Title>Types of Head Protection</Title>
            <Text>**Class A.** Class A hard hats and caps are intended for general service and they provide protection against impact hazards and a limited protection against electrical shock. They are used in industries such as construction, manufacturing, mining, and shipbuilding. This is the most suitable hard hat for shipboard use.

**Class B.** Class B hard hats are utility service hats which are designed to protect the wearer’s head from impact and penetration by falling or flying objects and from high-voltage shock and burns. They are used extensively by electrical workers.

Fig: ppe/hardhats.jpg "Hard Hat" class=left

**Class C.** The safety hat or cap in Class C is designed specifically for lightweight comfort and impact protection and is sometimes known as a bump cap. Class C helmets are used on occasions where there is a possibility of bumping the head against a fixed object and no danger from falling objects or electrical shock. Bump caps can be worn for protection against scalp lacerations from contact with sharp objects. However, they are not substitutes for safety caps/hats because they do not afford protection from high impact forces or penetration by falling objects.</Text>

            <Text>A job hazard analysis (JHA), also known as a job safety analysis (JSA), is a systematic process used to identify and analyze potential hazards or risks associated with specific job tasks or activities. Its primary purpose is to reduce the risk of accidents by identifying potential hazards and developing appropriate controls to mitigate them.
The process typically involves breaking down a job into its individual steps  and examining each step to identify potential hazards. Hazards can include physical hazards (e.g., machinery, equipment, or environmental conditions), chemical hazards (e.g., exposure to hazardous substances), biological hazards (e.g., exposure to infectious agents), ergonomic hazards (e.g., repetitive motion or lifting heavy objects), or any other factors that could pose a risk to worker safety and health.
The key steps in conducting a job hazard analysis typically include: 
&lt;ol&gt;
Select the job or task to be analyzed.
 Break down the job into steps.
 Identify potential hazards for each step.
 Determine the risk level for each identified hazard.  Risk level multiplies severity and the likelihood of each identified hazard.
 Develop hazard controls to eliminate or minimize the hazards. This might include engineering controls (e.g., machine guarding), administrative controls (e.g., training or procedures), or personal protective equipment (PPE)
 Communicate the findings to workers and stakeholders to ensure awareness and buy-in.
Regularly review and update the job hazard analysis.
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This results of the JHA can be shared with the crew during a toolbox talk in order to raise awareness about known hazards, reinforce safe work practices, and promote a culture of safety. These talks are usually conducted before the start of the work day.
Systematically analyzing and communicating job hazards and implementing appropriate controls helps to create a safer workplace.

            <Title>Energy Relationships in the Shipboard Propulsion Cycle</Title>
            <Text>The movement of a ship through the water is the result of a number of energy transformations. Although most of these transformations have been mentioned, they have not been discussed in the proper sequence.

The first energy transformation occurs when fuel oil is burned in the boiler furnace. By the process of combustion, the chemical energy stored in the fuel oil is transformed into thermal energy. Thermal energy flows from the burning fuel to the water in the boiler, and steam is generated. The thermal energy is now stored as internal energy in the steam, as we can tell from the increased pressure and temperature of the steam. When the steam is admitted to the turbines, the thermal energy of the steam is converted into mechanical energy, which turns the shaft and drives the ship. Two main energy transformations are involved in converting thermal energy to work in a turbine. First, the thermal energy of the steam is transformed into mechanical kinetic energy (energy of motion) as the steam flows through one or more nozzles. Second, the mechanical kinetic energy of the steam is transformed into work (mechanical energy in transition) as the steam strikes the projecting blades of the turbine and thus causes the turbine to turn. The turning of the turbine rotor causes the propeller shaft to turn also, although at a slower speed, since the turbine is connected to the propeller shaft through reduction gears. The steam exhausts from the turbine to the condenser where it gives up its latent heat of condensation to the circulating seawater.

For the remainder of this cycle, energy is required to get the water (condensate and feedwater) back to the boiler where it will again be heated and changed into steam. The energy used for this purpose is generally the thermal energy of the auxiliary steam. In the case of turbine driven feed pumps, the conversion of thermal energy to mechanical energy occurs in the same way as it does in the case of the propulsion turbines. In the case of motor-driven pumps, the energy conversion is from thermal energy to electrical energy (in a turbogenerator) and then from electrical energy to mechanical energy (work) in the pumps.

As you can see, putting in 1 BTU at the boiler furnace does not mean that 778 foot-pounds of mechanical energy will be available for propelling the ship through the water. Some of the energy put in at the boiler furnace is used by auxiliary machinery such as pumps and forced-draft blowers to supply the boiler with feedwater, fuel oil, and air for combustion. Distilling plants, turbo-generators, steering gears, heating systems, galley and laundry equipment, and many other units throughout the ship use energy derived directly or indirectly from the energy put in at the boiler furnace.

In addition, there are many “energy losses” throughout the engineering plant. As we have seen, energy cannot actually be lost. But when it is transformed into a form of energy that we cannot use, we say there has been an energy loss. Since no insulation is perfect, some thermal energy is always lost as steam travels through the piping. Friction losses occur in all machinery and piping. There is also an energy loss at the condenser as the steam exhausted from the turbines gives up heat to the circulating seawater and turns into condensate.

Although some energy losses can be partly avoided by designing the machinery and equipment to minimize friction losses, by insulating hot surfaces, and by lubricating moving parts, some energy losses are still unavoidable. Consider, for example, the unavoidable energy loss that occurs at the condenser. To allow the flow of heat, the condenser must be at a lower temperature than the boiler since heat flow can occur only from a higher temperature area to a lower temperature area. Therefore, the energy loss at the condenser is not only unavoidable, but is also actually required for the conversion of heat to work.

As you can see, each BTU that is put in at the boiler furnace has to be divided in many ways before all the energy can be accounted for, but the energy account will always balance. *Energy in will always equal Energy out.*</Text>

            <Text>Four hand operated nozzle control valves are mounted at the inlet to the high pressure turbine. Operation of these valves controls the steam admission to the first stage of the HP turbine. Opening more control valves increases the effective area of steam admission to the turbine, increasing its power output. Nozzle valves should be opened or closed as necessary to allow the ahead valve to be wide open whenever possible.</Text>

            <Text>Mechanical hazards are a physical hazards associated with machines and other movable objects that may cause harm to a person.
Injuries caused by mechanical hazards include friction or abrasion, lacerations, cutting, severing, pinching, crushing, or entanglement of body parts. Additionally, non-mechanical hazards such as chips, splashes, and sparks can injure you or others in the area.
Mechanical hazards can be managed by adopting safe work procedures and the application of appropriate safeguards. As such, you should always wear appropriate PPE, follow the machine’s operating instructions, and ensure that all machine safety features and guards are in place. Be aware that some machines may start automatically at any time, so take appropriate precautions including de-energizing and locking out machinery before working on it.</Text>

            <Title>Eye Protection</Title>
            <Text>Every day more than 1,000 eye injuries occur in American workplaces. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that three out of five workers who suffered eye injuries were not wearing eye protective equipment at the time of the accident, and when asked why, the victims often claimed that eye protection was not normally used in their type of work, or it was not required for the type of work performed at the time of the accident. Eye protection can save your sight, but you must be wearing it.
Eye injuries can occur in many ways, but are primarily caused by rapidly flying objects. The BLS found that almost 70% of eye injuries were caused by flying or falling objects or sparks striking the eye. Most of these objects were smaller than a pin head, and were traveling faster than a hand-thrown object. Another 20% of eye injuries were caused by chemicals, and the remainder due to miscellaneous causes such as objects swinging into the eye, pulled into the eye or by light radiation.
Eye injuries can be prevented by wearing effective eye protection. To be effective, the eyewear must be of the appropriate type for the hazard encountered and properly fitted. The BLS survey found that 94% of the injuries to workers wearing eye protection were caused by objects or chemicals going around or under the protector. Goggles provide better protection than face shields or safety glasses, but the best protection is afforded when both goggles and a face shield are worn together.</Text>

            <Title>Foot Protection</Title>
            <Text>Your feet are vulnerable to many potential hazards aboard ship. For example, slips and falls due to wet and slippery decks; heavy objects falling on or rolling over your foot because of the ship’s motion or accident; punctures caused by stepping on sharp objects; and potential electrical shock when your body is grounded through the soles of your shoes. In other industries, there are other hazards to consider, chemical exposure, high temperatures, molten metal splashes, static electricity, to name a few. Proper selection of footwear can minimize the danger of these hazards.

OSHA has established regulations for safety shoe design, including impact and compression strength requirements, and they have mandated footwear requirements for many industries. For example, safety shoes or boots with impact protection are required to be worn in work areas where carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection are required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual materials handling cars) or other activities in which materials or equipment could potentially roll over an employee’s feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection are required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a foot injury. Although there are no specific OSHA requirements for safety footwear for marine engineers, it is nonetheless sensible to select and wear safety shoes based on the hazards found in the engine room.</Text>

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Using Section Types: examples of this approach include the figure, table and equation setups. These are comprised of the following ingredients:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{} A “Section Type” that can be used to flag items in your binder as needing to be associated with a particular environment. If you look at the Table document template, you will see that in the Metadata inspector pane, it has been assigned to the “Table” section type.

\item{} A “Section Layout” in the compile format settings is what does the heavy lifting. Edit the Format for this project by going to File ▸ Compile…, right-click on the project template's Format in the left sidebar to edit it, and in the “Section Layouts” pane, examine the “Table w/ Captions” layout. The prefix and suffix tabs for this layout are where the actual LaTeX code will be inserted around the text you type in the editor.
\end{enumerate}

\item{} Using Styles: when environments are more likely to be found within a longer chunk of text, and would not be so useful broken out into their own sections, styles can also be used to insert a prefix and suffix around the text you type. The “Block Quote” or even “Emphasis” styles serve as examples of how this can be done. Visit the “Styles” pane in the compile format settings to examine how prefixes and suffixes are used with them.

            <Title>Respiratory Protection</Title>
            <Text>A respirator is a face piece, hood, or helmet that is designed to protect the user from a variety of harmful airborne agents. Respirators can protect you from dust and particulates in the air, hazardous vapors, oxygen deficiency, or a combination of these. Respirators are not necessary for routine operations in the engine room, but may be advisable during certain maintenance procedures such as chipping and painting.

OSHA regulations require that respirators shall be used in the following circumstances:

-   Where exposure levels exceed the *permissible exposure limit* (PEL),     during the time period necessary to install or implement feasible     engineering and work practice controls;
-   In those maintenance and repair activities and during those brief or     intermittent operations where exposures exceed the PEL and     engineering and work practice controls are not feasible or are not     required;
-   In regulated areas;
-   Where the employer has implemented all feasible engineering and work     practice controls and such controls are not sufficient to reduce     exposures to or below the PEL; and,
-   In emergencies.

Before using a respirator you should be thoroughly trained in its use. Some of the areas that you should be familiar with include: respiratory hazards; respirator selection criteria, limitations, adjustment, fit, cleaning, and storage procedures, etc. The selection of a suitable respirator depends on the hazard to which you are exposed, and the correct respirator cannot be selected without a thorough understanding of the hazard.</Text>

            <Title>Work</Title>
            <Text>Mechanical energy in transition is called *work.* When an object is moved through a distance against a resisting force, we say that work has been done. The formula for calculating work is:

\\[W=Fd\\]

Where: 

\\(W\\) = work (in foot-pounds)  
\\(F\\) = force (in pounds)  
\\(d\\) = distance moved in direction of applied force (in feet)

As you can see from this formula, you need to know how much force is exerted and the distance through which the force acts before you can find how much work is done. The unit of force is the pound. When work is done against gravity, the force required to move an object is equal to the weight of the object. Why? Because weight is a measure of the force of gravity or, in other words, a measure of the force of attraction between an object and the earth. How much work will you do if you lift that 5-pound rock from the bottom of the 100-foot cliff to the top? You will do 500 foot-pounds of work-the weight of the object (5 pounds) times the distance (100 feet) that you move it against gravity.

We also do work against forces other than the force of gravity. When you push an object across the deck, you are doing work against friction. In this case, the force you work against is not only the weight of the object; but also the force required to overcome friction and slide the object over the surface of the deck.

Notice that mechanical potential energy, mechanical kinetic energy and work are all measured in the same unit, foot-pounds. One foot-pound of work is done when a force of 1 pound acts through a distance of 1 foot. One foot-pound of mechanical potential energy or mechanical kinetic energy is the amount of energy that is required to accomplish 1 foot-pound of work.</Text>

            <Text>Always wear a welding helmet when arc welding. Your eyes, face, and neck need protection against the burning rays of the arc, and from the splatter of molten metal and slag. To protect your eyesight, make sure the welding helmet has a coloured lens with at least a No. 10 shade when welding with 200 amperes or less. And never strike a welding arc before your helmet is in place. Never look at an arc from any distance with your naked eyes while someone else is welding.

Never chip slag when your eyes (or those of others nearby) are not protected by goggles, an eye shield, or the clear lens of a welding helmet. If fragments of hot slag were to hit the eye, medical attention would be required for their removal, and blindness could result. The risk of permanent eye injury is so great that you should never chip slag from a weld without protecting your eyes.</Text>

            <Title>Butterfly Valves</Title>
            <Text>Fig: valves/Butterfly.png "Butterfly Valve" class=right 

Butterfly valves can be used for on-off operation as well as throttling or regulating fluid flow. They are light weight, require little installation space, have low initial cost, are simple in design and can be easily repaired. Like plug and ball type valves, it is only necessary to rotate the valve stem a quarter turn on a butterfly valve to go from the full open to the closed position. Manual operating levers on butterfly valves are parallel to the piping when the valve is open and perpendicular to the piping when the valve is closed. 90° valve stem operation makes them very adaptable to automatic and remote control actuators.

The disk in the butterfly valve is connected to the stem across its diameter. (See Figref(Butterfly.png) and Figref(exploded_butterfly.png)). When closed, the outer edge of the disk is in contact with a seat ring surrounding the opening through the valve body. To open the valve, the stem rotates the valve disk, until when fully open, the flat surfaces of the disk are parallel to the centerline of the pipe with fluid flowing past each side of the disk. 

The seat opening is lined with resilient, elastic materials like synthetic rubber, neoprene or Teflon. The disk edge presses into this material when closed to form a tight seal. 

Fig: valves/exploded_butterfly.png "Exploded view, Butterfly valve" class=left

In symmetrical type butterfly valves (stem is centered on the thickness of the disk), a tight seal is a problem where the stem passes off the edge of the disk. Symmetrical butterfly valves are generally satisfactory for tightly sealing fluid leakage in fluid systems up to approximately 200 psig and 180 °F.

To improve sealing, the eccentric or offset design butterfly valves are used. The stem is offset to one side of the disk so it does not interrupt the edge of the disk's seal with seat ring. The stem may also be installed across the disk to one side of the maximum diameter. This allows a major portion of the disk's edge to push it's way into the seat material rather than slide into it.

Offset butterfly valves seal tightly and have reasonable seat ring life up to about 700 psig with water to temperatures slightly above ambient. Pressure ratings drop with the rise in temperature with maximum temperature limits being 450 to 500 °F.</Text>

            <Title>Personal Survival Equipment</Title>
            <Text>A ship or boat has many of the same hazards found in shoreside workplaces, but in addition it has the danger of drowning. Fortunately, ships are equipped with several specialized pieces of safety equipment designed to help protect you in the watery environment. These include: life preservers, work vests, immersion suits, and thermal protective aids.

Fig: ppe/pfdti.png "Type I PFD"class=left

The main function of any PFD, of course, is to keep a person afloat, or buoyant-even with heavy clothes and gear. Its buoyancy also helps a stranded person save energy, because without a PFD a swimmer has to continually work to stay afloat. Some designs also help keep a victim’s face out of the water. A PFD’s buoyancy is the amount of weight it can keep afloat. High buoyancy is over 20 pounds. This may sound low, but water provides lift, so the average adult needs only 7 to 12 pounds of buoyancy.

A PFD can only save your life if it is available when you need it, and you wear it properly. Be sure you know where you keep your own life preserver and also where the spare PFD’s are stowed in the engine room. Use the opportunity at weekly boat drills to practice donning your life jacket, and inspect it frequently for tears and open seams; for lost buoyant material; for waterlogged, oil-soaked, or hardened buoyant material; and for proper functioning of the light and whistle.

**Type I life preserver.** This it the type of life preserver which is used by all hands aboard merchant ships. Every cadet is given instruction in its use during *STCW Basic Safety Training* during orientation.

The Type I life preserver is an international orange colored vest filled with a sufficient amount of inherently buoyant material to give it 22 pounds of buoyancy, and fitted with straps to hold it in position on the wearer. The PFD is equipped with a whistle for attracting attention, and reflective tape and a light to make it more visible at night. Because of its high buoyancy, it is bulky and not normally worn continuously while working.

**Type V PFD Work Vest.** This is a “one size fits all” work vest which provides basic flotation for workers who fall in the water. It is intended for people working in exposed locations over the water or near the edge of the deck, and also for deck crews on tugs and barges. It is assumed that rescue will occur quickly. A work vest is only approved for use consistent with its design.

The main advantage of a work vest is that is has relatively little bulk and does not significantly restrict the wearers movement, making it suitable for continuous wear. It is less buoyant than a Type I PFD and will not hold an unconscious wearer’s face clear of the water. Because it has less buoyancy a conscious wearer’s face may also be covered by waves in rough water.

**Immersion Suit.** Immersion suits, also known as survival suits or “gumby suits,” are a full body, insulated flotation device which can protect you from hypothermia and prevent you from drowning. Because hypothermia is a major factor in lives lost at sea, the U.S. Coast Guard now requires immersion suits on all documented vessels operating north of 32 degrees N and seaward of the Coastal Boundary Line.

Fig: ppe/gumby.png "Immersion Suit" class=right

Hypothermia, the lowering of a person’s core body temperature, can quickly kill anyone who ends up in the water for too long. A person’s survival time in the water depends on several factors including water temperature, the person’s body mass and build, and the insulating properties of his garments. Unprotected, a person will rapidly lose heat in cold water and can die in a matter of minutes. The insulated immersion suit can significantly improve survival time by reducing body heat loss to the water.

A typical immersion suit is made of bright international orange neoprene of sufficient buoyancy to keep you afloat, with a full-length zipper, face seal and flap, integral boots and mittens, and an inflatable head support. The Coast Guard requires all suits to be marked with 31 square inches of retro-reflective tape which improves your visibility and chances of being picked up. A whistle and strobe light are also required on ocean going vessels. Suits must be equipped with a Coast Guard Approved light which should be attached to the shoulder area. Suits must also be marked in “block capital letters” with the vessel name, and the name of the owner of the suit or the name of the person to whom the suit is assigned.

Proper care and maintenance of immersion suits will extend their working life and possibly your own. Routine suit inspections should include suit material and function of zippers and inflation hoses. Inspect for holes, tears or signs of wear. Suits used in salt water or in pools should be rinsed thoroughly inside and out with fresh water and turned inside out to dry, but not in direct sunlight. Grease and oil should be removed from suits with mild soap. Do not dry clean. Check all zippers for smooth operation. Lubricate zippers with a non-petroleum based product such as canning paraffin, beeswax or substance recommended by the manufacturer. Air bladders provide extra buoyancy and are vitally important in keeping the head out of water when lying horizontally in the water. At least once a year the bladder and inflation hose should be checked.

Store your suit in an accessible and dry place. Suits should be rolled and stowed in their bags with the zippers open and zipped up one inch from the bottom. Lubricate snaps and zippers on the bag.

Your immersion suit works properly only when you are wearing it in the water. Safety regulations for documented vessels that operate beyond the boundary lines or with more than 16 people, require monthly drills and instructions for donning immersion suits. First attempts can be awkward and exhausting but with practice you should succeed in getting into a suit in one minute or less. Practice seated donning of suit. This will be the most convenient methods in an actual high sea, emergency situation.


The following are the instructions for practice seated donning of an immersion suit:

1.  Roll suit out on deck and sit on it. Insert your legs into suit     using plastic bags to make it easier. Leave on boots and other     clothing for insulation and protection in the water.

2.  Place non-dominant arm into suit first (lefties-right and     righties-left). Pull hood over head with free hand.

3.  Place dominant arm in last. Pull the zipper up with care and secure     flap over your face.

4.  Make sure that all straps and hoses are secure to avoid being     snagged or injured. Do not inflate air bladder until you are in the     water.

**Thermal Protective Aids (TPA).** The Thermal Protective Aid (TPA) is an indispensable piece of survival gear. The TPA is a windproof, waterproof sack with arms and a hood, made of aluminized polyethylene similar to a space blanket. It is colored bright international orange, with reflective strips to make the it highly visible in all weather conditions. All SOLAS liferafts are required to carry enough TPAs for 10% of the rated crew capacity of the liferaft, or at least two per liferaft.

Fig: ppe/tpa.png "Thermal Protective Aid" width=300px

When worn, the TPA will protect you from exposure and low temperatures. Although it is not as effective as an immersion suit and provides no flotation, it is easy to don, compact to store, and its space blanket effect can prevent hypothermia by cutting down your heat loss from radiation and convection. Unfortunately, if you are immersed in the water, the suit will provide little insulation to heat loss by conduction, but it can save your life if you can get out of the water. </Text>

            <Title>Boiler</Title>
            <Text>Heat energy is added to the cycle by burning fuel oil in the boiler. The high temperature flames raise the temperature of the water in the boiler and eventually cause it to boil. Not all energy of the fuel is transferred to the water, some remains in the combustion gases and travels up the stack. This energy will be lost to the atmosphere unless it is recovered by economizers or air heaters located in the exhaust path. Any heat energy lost to the atmosphere represents waste and steam cycle inefficiency.

The reduction gear is necessary to change the HP turbine speed of about 6000 rpm to a much slower speed suitable for turning the propeller. The speed reduction accomplished by a gear is proportional to the ratio of the number of teeth on the driven gear to the number of teeth on the driving gear. Speed reductions up to about 1:12 can be accomplished with a single reduction, while higher reductions must be accomplished in multiple steps.</Text>

The first new item is the *condensate pump*, which is a centrifugal pump that takes suction on the condenser hot well and raises the condensate pressure enough to move it on to the DC heater. The condensate pump must pump from a vacuum, which is a difficult job for a pump. It is important to properly vent and seal the pump, or it will not pump well.</Text>

The furnace is the space inside the boiler where combustion occurs. Heat loss from the boiler is prevented by enclosing the furnace with a thermal insulating material known as *refractory*. The furnace is lined with three layers of refractory materials which work together to insulate the boiler. From inside to outside, the layers of refractory are:</Text>

            <Title>Vacuum</Title>
            <Text>A pressure below atmospheric pressure is called a vacuum. The farther below the atmospheric pressure, the greater the vacuum. Vacuum can not be made greater and greater without limit, however. At some point, the absolute pressure drops as low as possible and a perfect vacuum is achieved. A perfect vacuum is the lowest possible pressure, or the absence of all pressure. When we speak of a “high” vacuum, we are talking about a low absolute pressure.

When measuring a vacuum, there are three possible methods. When vacuum is measured starting with zero at perfect vacuum and increasing as pressure rises, then the greater the value, the smaller the vacuum. This is known as the absolute pressure scale. We can also measure pressure on a scale starting at zero at atmospheric pressure, and indicating negative values when the pressure is below atmospheric (vacuum) and positive values when the pressure is above atmospheric. This is the behavior of a standard pressure gage. And finally, we can measure vacuum on a scale starting with zero at atmospheric pressure and increasing as the vacuum increases. Most vacuum gages operate this way. On this scale no vacuum would be indicated by 0 psig, and a perfect vacuum would be indicated by approximately 14.7 psi vacuum.

The most common scale used on vacuum gages aboard ship display vacuum in inches of mercury, with the vacuum gage scale marked from 0 to 30 inches of mercury. When this gage reads zero, the pressure in the space is the same as atmospheric pressure or, in other words, there is no vacuum. A vacuum gage reading of 29.92 inches of mercury would indicate a perfect (or nearly perfect) vacuum. In actual practice, it is impossible to obtain a perfect vacuum even under laboratory conditions.</Text>

            <Title>Installation</Title>
            <Text>Globe valves are normally installed with the incoming fluid pressure applied to the bottom of the valve disk, that is, to the side of the disk that closes against the seat. The top of the disk is the side that does not close against the seat and, in most globe valves, is the side in contact with the valve stem. When fluid pressure is applied to the bottom of the disk, the pressure helps the operator open the valve, and the pressure on the valve packing is relieved when the valve is closed.

The only time a globe valve is installed with fluid pressure applied to the top of the disk is when the valve is used as a throttle valve controlling steam flow to an engine. Installed in this manner, if the disk were to become detached from the stem, the disk would be carried toward the seat by the steam flow. Even if the disk does not close tightly against the seat, it would choke off steam flow to the engine and cause it to slow down. Globe throttle valves installed in this manner are considered fail safe. If the valve was installed with the steam pressure on the bottom of the disk, and the disk became detached from the stem, the disk would be carried away from the seat by the steam flow and cause the engine speed to rise uncontrollably. The steam would also carry the disk toward the engine where it could enter and cause damage.

Globe valves cause a relatively large pressure drop in the fluid as it flows through the valve. Pressure drops are caused by the friction created when the fluid changes direction of flow through the valve. The straight globe valve, with the pipe connections 180 degrees opposite each other, has the greatest pressure drop through it due to three to five changes in direction of fluid flow. The right angle valve has a 90 degree angle between the inlet and outlet pipe connections and fluid flow only changes direction one or two times, creating less pressure drop than the straight type. Globe valves are also constructed with 45 or 60 degree angles between the stem and the outlet side of the valve. This valve design also creates less change in direction of fluid flow, reducing pressure drop through the valve.

A globe valve is fully open when the disk is raised ¼ of the diameter, *d*, of the seat opening. For full flow to take place through the globe valve, the area the fluid flows in through and the area the fluid flows out through must be equal. The inlet area is the hole in the seat, and is equal to the area of a circle or . The fluid flows out through the space between the top of the seat and the bottom of the disk which is the side of a cylindrical shape. The area of the side of a cylinder is equal to the circumference of the circle on the end of the cylinder times the height, *h* of the cylinder .</Text>

            <Title>Personal Survival Equipment</Title>
            <Text>A ship or boat has many of the same hazards found in shoreside workplaces, but in addition it has the danger of drowning. Fortunately, ships are equipped with several specialized pieces of safety equipment designed to help protect you in the watery environment. These include: life preservers, work vests, immersion suits, and thermal protective aids.

Fig: ppe/pfdti.png "Type I PFD"class=left

The main function of any PFD, of course, is to keep a person afloat, or buoyant-even with heavy clothes and gear. Its buoyancy also helps a stranded person save energy, because without a PFD a swimmer has to continually work to stay afloat. Some designs also help keep a victim’s face out of the water. A PFD’s buoyancy is the amount of weight it can keep afloat. High buoyancy is over 20 pounds. This may sound low, but water provides lift, so the average adult needs only 7 to 12 pounds of buoyancy.

A PFD can only save your life if it is available when you need it, and you wear it properly. Be sure you know where you keep your own life preserver and also where the spare PFD’s are stowed in the engine room. Use the opportunity at weekly boat drills to practice donning your life jacket, and inspect it frequently for tears and open seams; for lost buoyant material; for waterlogged, oil-soaked, or hardened buoyant material; and for proper functioning of the light and whistle.

**Type I life preserver.** This it the type of life preserver which is used by all hands aboard merchant ships. Every cadet is given instruction in its use during *STCW Basic Safety Training* during orientation.

The Type I life preserver is an international orange colored vest filled with a sufficient amount of inherently buoyant material to give it 22 pounds of buoyancy, and fitted with straps to hold it in position on the wearer. The PFD is equipped with a whistle for attracting attention, and reflective tape and a light to make it more visible at night. Because of its high buoyancy, it is bulky and not normally worn continuously while working.

**Type V PFD Work Vest.** This is a “one size fits all” work vest which provides basic flotation for workers who fall in the water. It is intended for people working in exposed locations over the water or near the edge of the deck, and also for deck crews on tugs and barges. It is assumed that rescue will occur quickly. A work vest is only approved for use consistent with its design.

The main advantage of a work vest is that is has relatively little bulk and does not significantly restrict the wearers movement, making it suitable for continuous wear. It is less buoyant than a Type I PFD and will not hold an unconscious wearer’s face clear of the water. Because it has less buoyancy a conscious wearer’s face may also be covered by waves in rough water.

**Immersion Suit.** Immersion suits, also known as survival suits or “gumby suits,” are a full body, insulated flotation device which can protect you from hypothermia and prevent you from drowning. Because hypothermia is a major factor in lives lost at sea, the U.S. Coast Guard now requires immersion suits on all documented vessels operating north of 32 degrees N and seaward of the Coastal Boundary Line.

Fig: ppe/gumby.png "Immersion Suit" class=right

Hypothermia, the lowering of a person’s core body temperature, can quickly kill anyone who ends up in the water for too long. A person’s survival time in the water depends on several factors including water temperature, the person’s body mass and build, and the insulating properties of his garments. Unprotected, a person will rapidly lose heat in cold water and can die in a matter of minutes. The insulated immersion suit can significantly improve survival time by reducing body heat loss to the water.

A typical immersion suit is made of bright international orange neoprene of sufficient buoyancy to keep you afloat, with a full-length zipper, face seal and flap, integral boots and mittens, and an inflatable head support. The Coast Guard requires all suits to be marked with 31 square inches of retro-reflective tape which improves your visibility and chances of being picked up. A whistle and strobe light are also required on ocean going vessels. Suits must be equipped with a Coast Guard Approved light which should be attached to the shoulder area. Suits must also be marked in “block capital letters” with the vessel name, and the name of the owner of the suit or the name of the person to whom the suit is assigned.

Proper care and maintenance of immersion suits will extend their working life and possibly your own. Routine suit inspections should include suit material and function of zippers and inflation hoses. Inspect for holes, tears or signs of wear. Suits used in salt water or in pools should be rinsed thoroughly inside and out with fresh water and turned inside out to dry, but not in direct sunlight. Grease and oil should be removed from suits with mild soap. Do not dry clean. Check all zippers for smooth operation. Lubricate zippers with a non-petroleum based product such as canning paraffin, beeswax or substance recommended by the manufacturer. Air bladders provide extra buoyancy and are vitally important in keeping the head out of water when lying horizontally in the water. At least once a year the bladder and inflation hose should be checked.

Store your suit in an accessible and dry place. Suits should be rolled and stowed in their bags with the zippers open and zipped up one inch from the bottom. Lubricate snaps and zippers on the bag.

Your immersion suit works properly only when you are wearing it in the water. Safety regulations for documented vessels that operate beyond the boundary lines or with more than 16 people, require monthly drills and instructions for donning immersion suits. First attempts can be awkward and exhausting but with practice you should succeed in getting into a suit in one minute or less. Practice seated donning of suit. This will be the most convenient methods in an actual high sea, emergency situation.


The following are the instructions for practice seated donning of an immersion suit:

1.  Roll suit out on deck and sit on it. Insert your legs into suit     using plastic bags to make it easier. Leave on boots and other     clothing for insulation and protection in the water.

2.  Place non-dominant arm into suit first (lefties-right and     righties-left). Pull hood over head with free hand.

3.  Place dominant arm in last. Pull the zipper up with care and secure     flap over your face.

4.  Make sure that all straps and hoses are secure to avoid being     snagged or injured. Do not inflate air bladder until you are in the     water.

**Thermal Protective Aids (TPA).** The Thermal Protective Aid (TPA) is an indispensable piece of survival gear. The TPA is a windproof, waterproof sack with arms and a hood, made of aluminized polyethylene similar to a space blanket. It is colored bright international orange, with reflective strips to make the it highly visible in all weather conditions. All SOLAS liferafts are required to carry enough TPAs for 10% of the rated crew capacity of the liferaft, or at least two per liferaft.

When worn, the TPA will protect you from exposure and low temperatures. Although it is not as effective as an immersion suit and provides no flotation, it is easy to don, compact to store, and its space blanket effect can prevent hypothermia by cutting down your heat loss from radiation and convection. Unfortunately, if you are immersed in the water, the suit will provide little insulation to heat loss by conduction, but it can save your life if you can get out of the water. </Text>

            <Title>Main Condenser[maincond]</Title>
            <Text>As stated before, the main condenser is a shell and tube heat exchanger which provides the low pressure zone for the turbine to discharge into. The steam entering the condenser turns back to liquid water when it comes in contact with the cold condenser tubes. The newly formed condensate drains down to the bottom of the condenser, where it collects in the *hot well* until it is pumped out.

In order to maintain high plant efficiency it is necessary to maintain a good vacuum in the main condenser. This vacuum is formed by the collapse of the steam as it condenses, since the specific volume of water is so much less than the specific volume of steam. A properly operating main condenser operates at 28.5 in Hg vacuum or greater.

Vacuum will be maintained in the condenser as long as the shell of the condenser does not fill up with air or other gases, however vacuum tends to draw air into the condenser through any available leaks, such as those found at the *turbine glands* where the turbine shafts penetrate the turbine casing. This air must be pumped back out to the atmosphere as fast as it leaks in, or else vacuum will be lost. This is accomplished with a steam driven pump known as the *air ejector* which takes suction on top of the main condenser and discharges air to the engine room.

Vacuum will also be lost if condensing stops. This could happen if the supply of cooling water through the condenser tubes was interrupted, perhaps due to failure of the main circulating pump, blocked condenser tubes, or if the condensate pump failed which would cause the condenser to fill up with condensate.</Text>

            <Text>
Fig: pumps/lobe.png "Lobe Pump" class=left

Lobe pumps operate on the same principle as gear pumps. There are two rotors turning in the pump chamber operating through timing gears on the shafts outside the pump chamber. Most rotors are fitted with two to three lobes (similar to large gear teeth) to push fluid from the suction to the discharge side of the pump. Although the design will handle both liquids or gases, they are more commonly found pumping gases. A common application is an air pump to supply or increase the air flow to diesel and gasoline engines as part of the system necessary to make them run or increase the horsepower of the engine. In most cases they are considered high volume, low pressure pumps.</Text>

            <Text>You will also find another kind of pressure unit, which appears to be a length. These units include inches of water, inches of mercury (Hg), or the height of some other liquid of known density. These units, while measured in length units, still represent a pressure. The length describes the pressure exerted by a column of liquid of the given height, and is known as the *head*. For example, a pressure reading of 1 inch of water (1 in. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) means that the exerted pressure is equal to the pressure exerted by a column of water 1 inch high, or that a column of water in a U-tube would be displaced 1 inch by the pressure being measured. Similarly, a reading of 12 inches of mercury (12 in. Hg) means that the measured pressure is sufficient to support a column of mercury 12 inches high. What is really being expressed (even though it is not mentioned in the pressure unit) is the fact that a certain quantity of material (water, mercury, etc.) of known density will exert a certain definite force upon a specified area. Pressure is still force per unit area even if the pressure unit refers to the height of some liquid.

Foreward
Non-fiction works often feature a foreword or preface. This usually comes after the table of contents, but not always—sometimes the foreword precedes the table of contents. If you need your foreword to come before the table of contents, move the \tableofcontents command in the “Preamble Addendum” document after “Foreword” document. You can also rename “Foreword” to ”Preface” or ”Introduction”, or delete it entirely, depending on your requirements.
The table of contents is generated automatically by LATEX, using the natural structure of the Draft folder’s outline in Scrivener’s. If you were using Scrivener in a more typical fashion, there would be a long list of instructions here on how to create a table of contents and manually keep it up to date over time.

Folder Names as Chapter Titles
The goal of this template is make the composition and drafting phase as simple and elegant as possible. It is not meant to turn Scrivener, a rich text editor, into a full-blown LaTeX generator (you’ll need to use MultiMarkdown or Pandoc for that). Instead, this project contains a number of convenience features that could be applied to your work as you wish in an la carte fashion, to alleviate how much code you’d need to type in yourself. For example, if you find handling images to be cumbersome in LaTeX, you can safely leave that up to the template.
Ultimately, it’s goal is to cater to those that by and large prefer to compose directly in LaTeX itself, and will be approaching Scrivener primarily as an organ- isational and composition tool for constructing a longer .tex file from the smaller snippets written into the Draft folder.
1.1 How To Use This Template
1. Inside the “Draft” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter num- bering will typically be taken care of automatically by LaTeX.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
2. Create a new text document for each section inside the chapter folders. Sec- tions will be numbered and titled by LaTeX using hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
3. Nest documents beneath documents to create numbered subsections, subsub- sections and unnumbered paragraphs, at 3rd, 4th and 5th levels of hierarchy respectively.
1
CHAPTER 1. FOLDER NAMES AS CHAPTER TITLES 2
4. If you need to create the occasional unnumbered section, the Informal Chap-
ter and Informal Section Types are there for you.
5. If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document in the Front Matter folder to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface”, “Ab- stract” or “Introduction” as you require. Any other prefacing materials could be placed between the preamble and the main matter document.
6. “Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, al- though you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents&gt;Change Icon feature).
1.2 Some Sample Content
Foremost, any LaTeX you type in yourself will be dutifully conveyed to the output. The compile settings also have a few shortcuts you can use to ease typing, or grant yourself a nicer looking working document. Graphics that you place into the editor (linked or embedded) will be exported simply wherever they occur in the text. For more formal figures there are two approaches you can take (you needn’t commit to either exclusively).
Figures
Figure 1.1: This is the caption.
To modify how styled text is converted to LaTeX code, visit the Markup and Styles compile format panes, when editing this project’s ”LaTeX (Memoir Book)” format. The Markup pane itself sets how graphics print themselves, which is the \includegraphics line alone. The stylesheet settings for Figure, Caption and Label determine how the additional syntax is added around that.
￼
CHAPTER 1. FOLDER NAMES AS CHAPTER TITLES 3 Equations
We can also insert equations as discrete items in the binder, making them easy to reference and look up by type. It also means we can refer to them in our writings with the use of simple internal document links (Equation 1.1).
x2 = 5−√25−4×6 =2 (1.1) 2
When you need to refer to an equation in the body text (β = (β1, β2, . . . , βn)), you can use the Inline Equation style which will insert the $ and $ codes for you.
Equations can also be inserted unnumbered

Another Chapter Folder
Begin each new chapter on a new top level folder like this. With LaTeX, the chapter numbering and formatting is handled automatically by the typesetting engine. Scrivener is only responsible for assembling the LaTeX code that will be used to generate these structures.
If you need parts, or if you don’t need chapters, the automatic assignment of structure to the outline can be adjusted in project settings, under the Section Types pane.

Class C helmets are used on occasions where there is a possibility of bumping the head against a fixed object and no danger from falling objects or electrical shock. Bump caps can be worn for protection against scalp lacerations from contact with sharp objects. However, they are not substitutes for safety caps/hats because they do not afford protection from high impact forces or penetration by falling objects.</Text>

            <Title>Arm and Hand Protection</Title>
            <Text>The National Safety Council has found that hands are the body part most frequently injured on the job. Accidents to the hand fall into these categories: abrasions, cuts, punctures, crushes, contact with moving machinery, burns, and chemical injuries. Gloves and hand protection are available to protect you from nearly all of these hazards. However, glove selection must be based on performance characteristics of the gloves, conditions, durations of use, and hazards present. One type of glove will not work in all situations.

In the engine room, particular hazards include high temperatures and moving machinery. Long sleeved shirts are advisable to protect your arms, and you should always have a pair of work gloves available to use when necessary to protect your hands when working around hot pipes. Special high temperature gloves should always be worn when changing burners, and the appropriate chemical resistant gloves should be worn when working with burner cleaning and boiler chemicals. You should also pay particular attention to avoid contact with moving parts of machinery or power tools with moving parts, and insure that safety guards are always in place. Gloves should always be inspected for damage before use.</Text>

            <Title>Eye Protection</Title>
            <Text>Every day more than 1,000 eye injuries occur in American workplaces. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that three out of five workers who suffered eye injuries were not wearing eye protective equipment at the time of the accident, and when asked why, the victims often claimed that eye protection was not normally used in their type of work, or it was not required for the type of work performed at the time of the accident. Eye protection can save your sight, but you must be wearing it.

Eye injuries can occur in many ways, but are primarily caused by rapidly flying objects. The BLS found that almost 70% of eye injuries were caused by flying or falling objects or sparks striking the eye. Most of these objects were smaller than a pin head, and were traveling faster than a hand-thrown object. Another 20% of eye injuries were caused by chemicals, and the remainder due to miscellaneous causes such as objects swinging into the eye, pulled into the eye or by light radiation.

Eye injuries can be prevented by wearing effective eye protection. To be effective, the eyewear must be of the appropriate type for the hazard encountered and properly fitted. The BLS survey found that 94% of the injuries to workers wearing eye protection were caused by objects or chemicals going around or under the protector. Goggles provide better protection than face shields or safety glasses, but the best protection is afforded when both goggles and a face shield are worn together.</Text>

            <Text>The *gland exhaust condenser* typically follows the air ejector condenser. This unit is used to condense any steam that leaks out of the turbine glands, in order to recover both the condensate and the heat. This is an example of the way a practical cycle takes every opportunity to recover “free” energy and increase the overall cycle efficiency.</Text>

            <Title>Hearing Protection </Title>
            <Text>Over the years, many marine engineers have suffered permanent hearing loss due to hours of exposure to the high noise levels in the engine room. You can prevent the loss of your own hearing by using proper hearing protection such as earplugs and earmuffs religiously whenever you are exposed to loud noises.

Your ear is a delicate instrument which contains thousands of fine hair cells called cilia to detect sounds. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can injure or break these cells or even tear off groups of these cells. Since the hair cells don’t ever repair themselves, when enough of them are damaged, a hearing loss results.

Short, intense, sounds such as an explosion can cause immediate and permanent hearing loss, but most hearing loss occurs gradually due to prolonged exposure to high noise levels. Most of the time this loss is so gradual that you are not even aware that it is occurring. Hearing loss is progressive and will continue to get worse as you continue to expose yourself to a noisy environment, but if you can avoid further exposure, the hearing loss won’t get any worse.

Permanent hearing loss is not the only hazard associated with noisy environments. Tinnitus is a condition where a ringing or roaring sound is heard continuously in one or both ears. Tinnitus occurs when the hair cells are damaged in such a way that they produce sound signals to the brain even in the absence of actual stimulation. This noise is sometimes described as like having a cricket permanently stuck in your ear, and is very annoying.

Sound intensity is measured in units of *decibels* (dB). The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale in which 0 dB indicates the quietest sound that can be heard by a normal person. A quiet library is about 20 dB. A normal conversation occurs at a sound level of about 60 dB. A lawnmower produces about 85 dB, and at this level you should be wearing hearing protection. Sandblasting or a rock concert has a sound intensity of about 115 dB. At this level hearing damage can occur after only about 15 minutes of unprotected exposure.

According to OSHA regulations, when the 8 hour average noise exposure is above 85 dB, employers are required to institute a noise monitoring program, provide adequate hearing protectors, and ensure employees wear them. Continual, unprotected exposure to noises louder than 85 decibels for 8 hours or more can be dangerous, and may result in hearing loss.

You can easily tell if you should be wearing hearing protection. If you find yourself in a situation where it is too noisy to carry on a conversation at arms length, or if you notice that your ears ring or feel plugged for a time after leaving a noisy environment, you can be sure that you should have been wearing your hearing protection.</Text>

            <Title>Feed Pump</Title>
            <Text>The feed pump serves the same purpose here as it does in the simplified cycle; that is, it raises the pressure of the feedwater sufficiently to force it into the boiler to begin the cycle again.

The feed pump is usually a turbine driven centrifugal pump, and the discharge pressure is about 50 to 100 psi above the pressure in the steam drum.</Text>

            <Title>Units of Measurement</Title>
            <Text>In engineering, temperature is commonly measured in degrees Fahrenheit. In this scale, the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure is designated 212°, and the freezing point is 32° with 180 equal degrees between. When working in the metric system, the Celsius scale is used. The Celsius scale (sometimes called the centigrade scale) uses zero as the freezing point of water and 100° as its boiling point, with 100 equal divisions or degrees between.

To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit: multiply by 1.8 and add 32.

\\[°\mathrm{F} = (1.8 \times °\mathrm{C}) + 32° \\]

The British thermal unit (BTU) is used to measure heat. Originally, 1 BTU was defined as the quantity of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water through 1° on the Fahrenheit (F) scale. A similar unit called the calorie (cal) was originally defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water through 1° on the Celsius (C) scale. The BTU and calorie are still in use, but the original definitions have been abandoned by international agreement. These units are now defined in terms of the unit of energy called the “joule.” By definition, 1 BTU is equal to 1054.886 joules, and 1 cal is equal to 4.18605 joules. As may be seen, the BTU is a much larger unit than the calorie; 1 BTU is equal to approximately 252 cal.</Text>

            <Title>Ball Valves</Title>
            <Text>Fig: valves/ball_valve.png "Ball Valve" class=right 

A ball valve, Figref(ball_valve.png), is similar to a plug valve except that a spherical rather than cylindrical plug is used. The ball has a hole or port bored through it and is made tight to the two openings in the body by plastic or synthetic rubber seat seal rings. These plastic or synthetic seat rings limit most ball valves to fluid temperatures of 350° or less. When the ball is rotated to the closed position, the fluid pressure pushes the ball tightly against the outlet seat ring insuring tight closure.

Ball valves are compact, self-sealing, non-sticking, require little effort to rotate the valve stem and they provide smooth fluid flow. Since the port in the ball is normally the same I.D. as the piping, the ball valve offers little resistance to flow and low pressure drop.</Text>

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and other work accessories designed to create a barrier against workplace hazards. It provides an important link in the chain of workplace safety, but PPE alone is not a substitute for safe engineering design, proper training, good work practices, safety awareness, or hazard reduction. All these elements together are required to minimize the danger of workplace hazards and maximize the safety and health of workers.
Using personal protective equipment requires hazard awareness and training on the part of the user. You must be trained to know when personal protective equipment is necessary, what type is necessary, how it is to be worn, and what its limitations are, as well as know its proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal. In addition, you must be aware that the equipment does not eliminate the hazard. If the equipment fails, you can be injured. To reduce the possibility of failure, equipment must be properly fitted, and maintained in a clean and serviceable condition.
To protect yourself, you must be wearing the proper personal protective when it is needed and recognize its limitations. The equipment must not be altered or removed even though you may find it uncomfortable. In some cases however, the equipment may be uncomfortable because it does not fit properly.
In this chapter we will discuss some of the personal protective equipment normally found and used aboard ship.</Text>

The refractory materials are held in position with anchor bolts which are connected to the inner casing. The refractory support system must be designed to account for the rolling of the vessel, and to permit expansion and contraction caused by temperature changes.</Text>

            <Text>Electrical malfunctions can generate heat and sparks, leading to electrical fires. Faulty wiring, overloaded circuits, damaged electrical cords, and short circuits are common causes of electrical fires. These fires can quickly spread and pose a significant risk to property and life. The combination of electricity and flammable materials increases the likelihood of a fire and makes it more challenging to extinguish.

            <Title>Superheater Vent</Title>
            <Text>Whenever there is a flame in the boiler, there must be steam flow through the superheater. Without this steam flow, the superheater tubes will overheat and burn out. Insuring steam flow through the superheater is not a problem when the boiler is operating on the line, since the normal flow to the turbine and auxiliaries provides sufficient flow, but it is significant during the boiler warm up period and during boiler casualties. At these times, it is critical to open the *superheater vent valve* located on the superheater outlet. Opening this valve permits a small amount of steam to flow up the smokestack and provide sufficient cooling to protect the superheater.</Text>

            <Title>Eye Protection for Welding</Title>
            <Text>Always wear a welding helmet when arc welding. Your eyes, face, and neck need protection against the burning rays of the arc, and from the splatter of molten metal and slag. To protect your eyesight, make sure the welding helmet has a colored lens with at least a No. 10 shade when welding with 200 amperes or less. And never strike a welding arc before your helmet is in place. Never look at an arc from any distance with your naked eyes while someone else is welding.

Never chip slag when your eyes (or those of others nearby) are not protected by goggles, an eye shield, or the clear lens of a welding helmet. If fragments of hot slag were to hit the eye, medical attention would be required for their removal, and blindness could result. The risk of permanent eye injury is so great that you should never chip slag from a weld without protecting your eyes.</Text>

            <Title>Pressure</Title>
            <Text>The primary indicator of the “health” of the main condenser is the condenser vacuum – the higher the vacuum, the better the plant efficiency. The shell vacuum of a condenser is primarily determined by the design of the condenser: the number of tubes, the heat transfer surface, the coolant flow rate, etc; but operational factors such as ocean temperature, cleanliness of the tubes, and air leaks into the shell also influence the vacuum.

To achieve high vacuum, we must reduce the absolute pressure in the condenser to a minimum. The absolute pressure is determined by two factors: the saturation pressure of the steam at the temperature of the cold tubes, and the partial pressure of the air and non condensible gases in the condenser shell. The actual or *total* pressure is the sum of these two factors. Good condensation occurs when there is sufficient, cold, circulating water passing through clean condenser tubes. But to achieve the best possible vacuum at a given seawater condition, you must also remove air and non condensible gases from the condenser shell as quickly as they leak in. Besides ruining the vacuum, air leaks form an insulating film blanket around the condenser tubes, which lowers heat transfer and reduces the condenser effectiveness, and the oxygen contained in the air is corrosive to iron and steel.

Low vacuum can be caused by many malfunctions. Some of the more common are:

-   Excessive air leakage into the condenser, most likely entering     through the turbine glands.
-   Improper functioning of the air ejector or vacuum pump, preventing     effective air removal.
-   Air leakage through a vacuum drag line.
-   High condensate level, reducing effective heat transfer surface in     the condenser.
-   Insufficient flow of circulating water, causing high condensing     temperature
-   High saltwater temperature, causing high condensing temperature.</Text>

            <Title>Economizer[econ]</Title>
            <Text>After the feedwater enters the boiler it passes through the *economizer*.

The economizer is a heat recovery device. It consists of a finned-tube heat exchanger which is heated by the boiler exhaust gases before they pass up the stack. This is the final effort to improve the efficiency of the steam cycle, by recovering heat energy that would otherwise be lost.

On some ships, the economizer is absent, and in its place is another heat exchanger, the *heat-recovery type air preheater* which is designed to raise the temperature of the air used for combustion. On ships with air heaters, one or two additional stages of regenerative feed heaters are usually installed in the feed line, between the feed pump and the boiler, to improve overall cycle thermal efficiency.

An economizer or an air preheater will normally be found in a steam cycle, but not both. If both were present, they would tend to lower the exhaust gas temperature to the point where any water vapor in the exhaust would condense. While thermodynamically desirable, this introduces the practical problem that the condensed moisture combines with the other products of combustion to form a corrosive mixture of sulfuric acid in the exhaust.

After leaving the economizer the feedwater enters the steam drum where the generation stage occurs, where the steam cycle begins again.</Text>

            <Title>Dry Pipe</Title>
            <Text>The dry pipe is located inside the steam drum, near the top. In its simplest form the dry pipe is simply a pipe with holes drilled into the top portion. Steam enters the dry pipe before it leaves the boiler.

The dry pipe is designed to allow steam to enter, but to exclude water droplets and moisture. Moisture in the steam, known as *carryover* is bad, because high velocity water droplets in the steam would cause damage to the blades and thrust bearings in the turbine. Improper operation of the boiler, for instance letting the steam drum water level get too high, could cause carryover.</Text>

            <Text>Figref(simplified.png) shows a very simplified version of the steam cycle, which is an appropriate starting point for our discussion of ship’s propulsion. 

The steam cycle is an example of what is known by engineers as a *cyclic heat engine*. It is called cyclic, because it operates on a cycle. It uses a *working fluid*, water, which travels from point to point through the cycle, changing form and carrying energy, but eventually returning to the starting point restored to the same *state* that it started with. It is called a heat engine, because it transforms *heat*, which is a form of energy, into *work*, another form of energy. The thermodynamic name for this cycle is the *Rankine Cycle.*

The steam cycle consists of four stages

1.  generation
2.  expansion
3.  condensation
4.  recovery
Since this is a cycle, it has no beginning or end, but *we* have to start somewhere, so let’s begin with the generation stage.

            <Text>The condenser hotwell is fitted with a *sight glass* to indicate the condensate level. Normally the condensate pump will pump out condensate as quickly as it is formed, and the hotwell level will remain relatively steady and visible in the glass. Condensate pump failure or too much condensate entering the hotwell can cause the hotwell to fill up, and at some point the rising condensate level will submerge some or all of the condenser tubes, hindering effective heat transfer and reducing the condenser vacuum.

If the hotwell level is too high: check the condensate pump for proper operation and close off the make-up feed and condensate recirculation valves to restore the level.</Text>

            <Title>Specific Heat</Title>
            <Text>In the discussion of sensible heat and latent heat, you may have noticed that it takes only 16 BTU to raise the temperature of 1 pound of ice from 0 °F to 32 °F that is, only 1/2 BTU for each degree of rise in temperature. However, we know that it takes 1 BTU (on the average) to raise the temperature of the same amount of water 1 °F. This difference occurs because the *specific heat* of water is about twice the specific heat of ice.

Specific heat is a thermal property of matter that must be determined experimentally for each substance. In general, we may say that specific heat is the property of matter; this explains the reason that equal quantities of thermal energy added to two different substances will not necessarily produce the same temperature rise, even when no change of state is involved. The specific heat of a substance is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of the substance 1 °F. For most engineering applications, specific heat is expressed in BTU per pound per degree Fahrenheit. In metric systems of measurement, specific heat is expressed in calories per gram per degree Celsius. Even though the units of measurement are different in the different systems, the *numerical value* of specific heat for any given substance is the same in all systems. The specific heat of water is 1.00 in all systems.

            <Title>Transforming Heat to Work</Title>
            <Text>The energy transformation of primary interest in the shipboard steam plant is the transformation from heat to work. To see how this transformation occurs, we need to consider the pressure, temperature, and volume relationships which hold true for gases. These relationships may be summarized as follows:

-   When the temperature is held constant, increasing the pressure on a     gas causes a proportional decrease in volume. Decreasing the     pressure causes a proportional increase in volume.

-   When the pressure is held constant, increasing the temperature of a     gas causes a proportional increase in volume. Decreasing the     temperature causes a proportional decrease in volume.

-   When the volume is held constant, increasing the temperature of a     gas causes a proportional increase in pressure. Decreasing the     temperature causes a proportional decrease in pressure.

Suppose we have a boiler in which steam has just begun to form. With the steam stop valves still closed, the volume of the steam remains constant while the temperature and the pressure are both increasing. When operating pressure is reached and the steam stop valves are opened, the high pressure of the steam causes the steam to flow to the turbines. The pressure of the steam thus provides the potential for doing work; the actual conversion of heat to work is done in the steam turbines. The change in the internal energy (as indicated by changes in pressure and temperature) of the steam between the boiler and the condenser is an indication of the amount of heat that has been converted to work in the turbines.

Since heat is measured in BTU and work is measured in foot-pounds, how can we compare the amount of energy put in as heat with the amount of energy put out as work? At first glance, asking how much heat equals how much work might seem like asking how many lima beans equals playing baseball. However, the problem is not that difficult, since both heat and work are forms of energy. The formula for converting heat to work is

\\[1 \mathrm{ BTU} = 778 \mathrm{ ft-lb} \\]

or, in other words, the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water 1 °F is the same as the amount of energy required to lift a 1-pound weight 778 feet against the force of gravity.</Text>

            <Title>First Stage Heater Unit</Title>
            <Text>The next stop in the steam cycle is the first stage heater. This unit contains two internal sections: the drain cooler and the first stage heater, in that order. Both of these sections helps improve cycle efficiency by providing additional heat to the condensate.

This unit provides a form of *regenerative feed heating* which can be shown to improve the overall efficiency of the cycle. In regenerative heating, a portion of the steam from within the turbine is bled off before it has fully expanded. This steam, which is still quite hot, is used to preheat the condensate. Some shore power plants have four or more stages of regenerative heating.

*Low pressure bleed* steam is used as the steam supply for the first stage heater. The bleed steam condenses as it gives up its energy to the condensate, and the condensed bleed steam, known as *drains* is still hot enough to be used to preheat the condensate. The drains then enter the *drain cooler section* where the remaining heat is recovered, before the drains are returned to the system by vacuum drag to the main condenser.

In some designs, the gland exhaust condenser is incorporated into the first stage heater unit as well, rather than a separate heat exchanger as we have on the *Kennedy*. In any event, the flow order through these three heat exchangers is always from coolest to hottest. Therefore the gland exhaust condenser comes first, followed by the drain cooler, and finally the first stage heater.</Text>

            <Title>Description</Title>
            <Text> A typical DC Heater is shown in Figref(dc_heater.png). It consists of a large tank capable of holding several hundred gallons of water, with a condensate inlet connection fed from the main condensate pump, and an outlet to the main feed pump. Heating steam is supplied from the auxiliary exhaust system and there is a connection to discharge accumulated air and non-condensible gases.

Internally there are spray nozzles and baffles to insure that there is a thorough mixing of the water and steam to provide effective heating and deaeration. A vent condenser found at the very top of the heater is provided to remove the final traces of steam from the non-condensibles, and a strainer at the bottom prevents large objects from entering the feed pump.

Fixtures found on the outside of the DC Heater include: a gage glass, a pressure gage, a water level sensor, a relief valve, and a vacuum breaker. Inlet connections for high pressure drains and the feed pump recirculation line are also found there. The water gage glass permits direct observation of the water level in the heater, while the level sensor provides this same information to the eye-high indicator at the main operating station. It is this water level that we use to determine the amount of water contained in the steam cycle.

The DC Heater is a closed tank and is considered by the Coast Guard to be an unfired pressure vessel, so it must be equipped with a relief valve to protect it against bursting due to a high pressure developing inside. It is also equipped with a vacuum breaker that would allow air to enter the tank if a vacuum developed inside when the steam supply is secured.

&gt; **Deaeration, why and how?**

&gt;Water exposed to the atmosphere normally contains dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide \\((CO_2)\\) and oxygen \\((O_2)\\) in solution. Even in the closed steam cycle, gases can enter with with the make-up feed and through air leakage into the condensers. When water is heated in the boiler, these dissolved gas molecules are released and combine with water \\((H_2O)\\) to form *carbonic acid*, \\((H_2CO_3)\\).

&gt; \\[CO_2 + O_2 + H_2O \rightarrow H_2CO_3\\]

&gt;Carbonic acid corrodes and pits equipment and piping, and it also dissolves iron (Fe) which results in scaling on the boiler and tubes, which can cause overheating and is wasteful of energy. For these reasons, the removal of oxygen and carbon dioxide from boiler feedwater is important for equipment longevity and safe operation.

&gt;*Deaeration* is the term given to the removal of dissolved gases from feedwater, and it can be accomplished mechanically or chemically. Aboard ship we use both methods: mechanical deaeration in the DC Heater removes almost all the dissolved gases, and the remainder are eliminated with chemical oxygen scavengers.

&gt;*Mechanical deaeration* is based on the laws of physics. Thermodynamics shows that the entropy of the free gas is greater than the entropy of the dissolved gas, so as temperature increases, the solubility of the gases decreases. Henry's law states that, at a given temperature, the amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid. Simplified, this means that heating the boiler feedwater drives out dissolved gases, and venting them away means they won't be reabsorbed.

&gt;The best way to mechanically deaerate feedwater is to force steam into it, in a process known as scrubbing. Scrubbing raises the water temperature causing the release of \\(O_2\\) and \\(CO_2\\) gases which are then vented from the system. In boiler systems, steam is used to "scrub" the feedwater because steam is high temperature, essentially devoid of \\(O_2\\) and \\(CO_2\\), and is readily available.

&gt;There are three requirements for efficient scrubbing: First, you must heat the feedwater to the boiling point which depends on the operating pressure. Raising the temperature of the water lowers the solubility of the dissolved gases, and when the temperature reaches the boiling point, the solubility goes to zero. Second, you must break the water up into fine particles and agitate them with the steam. This increases the surface area exposed to the steam, which enables the water to be heated to saturation temperature quickly and reduces the distance the gases have to travel to be liberated. Agitation helps the gas molecules escape the surface films surrounding the water droplets. And finally, you must vent the liberated gases to allow their escape from the system as they are released, and to maintain a low partial pressure surrounding the droplets.

&gt;*Chemical deaeration* can be used to remove the last traces of dissolved oxygen. While the most efficient mechanical deaerators reduce oxygen to very low levels (.005cc/l or 5 ppb), even trace amounts of oxygen may cause corrosion damage to a system. Consequently, good operating practice requires the use of a chemical oxygen scavenger such as sodium sulfite or hydrazine for complete deaeration.

&gt;*Hydrazine* \\((N_2H_4)\\) is a colorless, mobile liquid with a week ammonia-like odor. When maintained in the boiler water in concentrations between 0.1 and 0.3 ppm it will react with oxygen to form water and nitrogen according to this chemical reaction:

&gt;\\[N_2H_4 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O + N_2\\]

&gt;Excess hydrazine in a boiler breaks down to produce ammonia, which raises the pH of the boiler water and provides some additional protection to the system by neutralizing any carbon dioxide.

&gt;Hydrazine should be handled with care since it is carcinogenic and causes eye, nose and throat irritation and temporary blindness. It is recommended that when handling liquid hydrazine, you should wear an apron or protective suit, chemical safety goggles and/or face shield, and butyl rubber gloves and boots. Leather shoes should not be worn when handling hydrazine since hydrazine cannot be removed from leather. If hydrazine spills on leather shoes, remove and discard them immediately.</Text>

            <Title>Non-Fiction Format for LaTeX</Title>
            <Text>General Non-Fiction (LATEX)
About This Template
The goal of this template is make the composition and drafting phase as simple and elegant as possible. It is not meant to turn Scrivener, a rich text editor, into a full-blown LaTeX generator (you'll need to use MultiMarkdown or Pandoc for that; consider using the General Non-Fiction template if that is what you are looking for). Instead, this project contains a number of convenience features that could be applied to your work as you wish in an à la carte fashion, to alleviate how much code you'd need to type in yourself. For example, if you find handling images to be cumbersome in LaTeX, you can safely leave that up to the template.
This template caters to those that by and large prefer to compose directly in LaTeX itself, and will be approaching Scrivener primarily as an organisational and composition tool for constructing a longer .tex file from the smaller snippets written into the Draft folder.
When compiled (File ▸ Compile…), this project will generate a bare bones .tex document (using the flexible Memoir class) suitable for many types of work, fiction and non-fiction alike. The template achieves this by using advanced features available to the Plain Text compile file type, including providing the default extension of ".tex" instead of ".txt".
How To Use This Template
	◆	Inside the “Draft” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. (LaTeX itself will of course handle all numbering schemes.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
	◆	Create a new text document for each section inside the chapter folders. Sections will be numbered and titled by LaTeX using hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
	◦	Nest documents beneath documents to create numbered subsections, subsubsections and unnumbered paragraphs, at 3rd, 4th and 5th levels of hierarchy respectively.
	◦	You can of course also nest folders if you prefer.
	◆	If you need to create the occasional unnumbered section, the Informal Chapter and Informal Section Types can be manually applied to those sections.
	◆	If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document in the Front Matter folder to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface”, “Abstract” or “Introduction” as you require. Adjust the title, table of contents and other front matter material within this folder, placing any additional front matter sections between the “Begin Document” and “Begin Main Matter” items.
	◆	“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents ▸ Change Icon feature).
General Writing Tips
Foremost, any LaTeX you type in yourself will be dutifully conveyed to the output. As such, you can treat the main editor in Scrivener much like you would a dedicated text editor such as TeXShop. You may still prefer to use another editor to construct LaTeX syntax more easily, or take advantage of the syntax highlighting these types of editors can afford. Simply copy and paste the results of your writings into Scrivener when you’re ready to “save” them.
Adjusting Outline Structure
Scrivener is designed so that you can use the Draft outline flexibly. The default settings for this template are set up to consider all items at the first level within the draft as chapters. Beneath that, all items will be considered sections, subsections and so on down to the \paragraph environment. To adjust these settings, use the Project ▸ Project Settings… menu command, click on the “Section Types” pane, and then the “Default Types by Structure” tab. For example, if you wanted the top level of the Draft to use parts instead of chapters, you could select “Part” (which has already been set up for you) for the Level 1 assignments, and then adjust all greater levels of depth accordingly.
It is also worth noting that under default settings, if you omit a title for a binder item it will become "anonymous", not producing any title material and by extension opting out of being a part of the formal structure of the document as compiled. You could also manually assign an item to the “N/A” section type to cause it to be printed as-is, if you would prefer to give it an casual outlining title.
Compiling
	◆	The “Front Matter” folder contains some example preamble of the sort that would follow the more rudimentary setup of the document's overall look and feel (that is delegated to the compile Format itself, making it possible to create your own target formats and switch document classes with a single click).
	◆	A “Back Matter” folder is also provided. Here you can add any back matter you wish to include before the final \end{document} command. Nothing provided in this folder is necessary for a simple document to be typeset.  An example structure has been provided for including an appendix. The folder itself is assigned to the "Appendix" Section Type, which is responsible for titling the section and then starting the formal appendix portion of the document. Within that folder the ordinary structural rules for the Draft folder will be adhered to, meaning you can construct complex appendices with sections, subsections and so forth, based on the hierarchy of the outline. If you do not need an appendix, you can remove this folder.
To compile:
	1.	Go to File ▸ Compile…
	2.	Next to “Compile for”, select “Plain Text (.txt)”.
	3.	Select the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format on the left.
	4.	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right. If you do not do this the resulting .tex file will not properly typeset until the example material has been copied to an area included in the compile (such as the top of the Draft folder). The “Add back matter” feature is optional.
	5.	Click on Compile, open the .tex file in your preferred editor and typeset the document.
To compile directly to PDF:
	1.	Go to File ▸ Compile…
	2.	Double-click the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format to edit it.
	3.	Click on the Processing compile format pane.
	4.	Enable the “Post-Process on command-line” option to enable the built-in script.
	5.	Optional: click the “Edit Script” button and review the script for any changes you would like to make. The script is set up to use XeLaTeX, you might prefer to use the -pdf switch instead, for pdflatex output.
	6.	Optional: ensure that the Environment field includes the path to your texbin (for example “/Library/TeX/texbin”, as set up by MacTex).
	7.	Click the Save button, and then Compile. Note you will be supplying the name of the intermediary .tex file. The .pdf will use the base name, so “something.tex” will become “something.pdf” in the end.
To create your own document class variation:
	1.	Go to File ▸ Compile…
	2.	Right-click on the “LaTeX (Memoir Book)” compile format on the left, and select Duplicate &amp; Edit Format….
	3.	Rename the format at the top to match your intended edits.
	4.	Click on the Text Layout compile format preference pane.
	5.	Modify the prefix and suffix fields to include you preferred preamble and footer.
	6.	Since some of the LaTeX code used elsewhere in the settings may require adjustment to work outside of Memoir, you might need to audit the rest of the format's panes and content therein.
	7.	Click on Save.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.
Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few things to the binder and set everything up in ways that should be useful to authors working toward the LaTeX typesetting system. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.
You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File ▸ Save As Template….
The rest of this guide will go over the numerous convenience features that have been added to this project.
Figures
To ease typing extensive syntax and managing your images by hand, or to simply grant yourself a nicer looking working document, you can make use of Scrivener’s native inline &amp; linked image handling facilities. Graphics that you place into the editor will be exported as files and syntax will be inserted where the image was placed. For more formal figures there are two approaches you can take (you needn't commit to either exclusively):
	◆	In your text: use the "Figure" paragraph style to have the graphic enclosed in a \begin{figure} \centering ... \end{figure} environment. You can optionally insert a caption below the image (still within the "Figure" paragraph style, so as to keep it within the environment), using the "Caption" character style. Follow the caption with a "Label" styled phrase that is a valid LaTeX style bookmark label, to give this figure a cross-reference you can refer to elsewhere. With an eye on the Format Bar, click into the three different elements below; image, caption and label, to see which styles are applied to them:
#
This is the caption. latexLogo
The example provided above would generate the following LaTeX syntax when compiled:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=175pt,height=73pt]{800px-LaTeX_logo.png}
\caption{This is the caption.} 
\label{latexLogo}
\end{figure}
	◆	As a binder item: if you prefer keeping figures in separate chunks in the binder, to facilitate searching and organisation, you can use the "Figure" Section Type setting, placing the graphic in the main editor (un-styled) and supplying the caption as custom metadata in the Inspector. (A document template has been supplied for your convenience, and with an Example Figure item in the “Research” folder for your reference.) When using this technique figure labelling will be handled automatically for you, and captioning will be done in the inspector sidebar. To cross-reference to the figure in the text, refer to the following section on cross-referencing.
Figure Customization
To modify how styled text and embedded images are converted to LaTeX code, visit the Markup and Styles compile format panes, when editing this project's "LaTeX (Memoir Book)" format. The Markup pane itself sets how graphics print themselves, which is the \includegraphics line alone. The stylesheet settings for Figure, Caption and Label determine how the additional syntax is added around that.
To modify how images are converted to LaTeX when including them as binder items, visit the Section Layouts compile format pane and adjust the "Figure w/ Caption" layout's Prefix and Suffix tabs. As with styled text, the Markup pane is what is used to insert the graphic itself between the prefix and suffix.
Equations
A few helpful packages for equation typesetting can be enabled with the Equation Packages module, in the front matter folder. As with figures, equations can be added either to your binder as discrete items using dedicated Section Types, or into the text itself using Styles.
In your text
Use the "Equation" paragraph style to enclose the selected text within a \begin{figure} ... \end{figure} environment. Use the Label character style to supply a target label to the equation, if it should be numbered and be capable of being cross-referenced. Below is an example equation and label; note how the label character style is placed within the equation paragraph itself:
P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}&gt;4\right) eq:custom-label
The example provided above would generate the following LaTeX syntax when compiled:
\begin{equation}
P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}&gt;4\right) \label{eq:custom-label}
\end{equation}
As a binder item
For those that prefer to keep major elements as separate binder items, this project has two document templates designed to faciliate the organisation of equations: "Equation" and "Unnumbered Equation". If you will require cross-referencing to refer to your equations, the first option is what you want. Numbered equations will be automatically labelled for you, with that label used by internal document links pointing to it, elsewhere in the Draft. Consequently, you should not supply your own \label{...} code (or use the style) with the equation text itself. Additionally you should not use the Equation style itself, within an Equation document.
Inline equations, embedded in paragraph text, are easily formatted using raw LaTeX, but if you wish to keep your source material clean of syntax, a character style has been provided with this project. Simply paint the equation with the style, and it will add the markers for you.
Tables
Scrivener cannot convert rich text tables into LaTeX code for you. You will need to provide the proper syntax yourself, however you can focus on the tabular data itself, leaving the boilerplate text to Scrivener by making use of the “Table” Section Type when applied to individual binder items. As with binder figures, you can supply a caption as metadata. A document template has been provided as an example starting point. Working this way means you can make global adjustments to table appearance more easily, by editing the “Table w/ Caption” section layout, in the compile format settings.
Itemised and Enumerated Lists
As with tables, Scrivener cannot convert its native listing environments to LaTeX. If you would prefer the convenience of these features, for simple lists you could make use of the “Itemized List” and “Enumerated List” styles, included in this template. You will note that simple hanging indent paragraph style will be used in the editor (along with a shaded background to indicate the type of list). When compiled with the provided format, these styles will be enclosed in the proper listing environment, and will prefix each line with the \item code.
Given that basic capability, you could embellish the standard output the compiler produces with your own LaTeX code inside the styled range, and thus produce nested lists.
Creating Your Own Environments
This template includes a variety of common environments already set up for you, but it is quite likely that you will need to create your own. There are two different approaches, both demonstrated in this template:
Using Section Types
Examples of this approach include the figure, table and equation setups. These are comprised of the following ingredients:
	◆	A “Section Type” that can be used to flag items in your binder as needing to be associated with a particular environment. If you look at the Table document template, you will see that in the Metadata inspector pane, it has been assigned to the “Table” section type.
	◆	A “Section Layout” in the compile format settings is what does the heavy lifting. Edit the Format for this project by going to File ▸ Compile…, right-click on the project template's Format in the left sidebar to edit it, and in the “Section Layouts” pane, examine the “Table w/ Captions” layout. The prefix and suffix tabs for this layout are where the actual LaTeX code will be inserted around the text you type in the editor.
Using Styles
When environments are more likely to be found within a longer chunk of text, and would not be so useful broken out into their own sections, styles can also be used to insert a prefix and suffix around the text you type. The “Block Quote” or even “Emphasis” styles serve as examples of how this can be done. Visit the “Styles” pane in the compile format settings to examine how prefixes and suffixes are used with them.
Cross-References
Whenever you create a document link to another document within the compiled output, Scrivener will use an internally generated bookmark label to create an \autoref{...} link to that section. This works for the following Section Types automatically:
	◆	Part
	◆	Chapter
	◆	Section
	◆	Subsection
	◆	Subsubsection
	◆	Figure
	◆	Table
	◆	Equation
LaTeX will of course handle the rest of the job, in terms of numbering and correctly labelling the links. To adjust the behaviour of the code produced by Scrivener, modify the link prefix and suffix settings in the Markup compile format pane.
Typographic Punctuation
If you prefer to use LaTeX style punctuation yourself while writing, then Scrivener will not get in your way in doing so. However if you prefer to use its automatic typographic punctuation features (smart quotes, dashes and ellipses), the compile format has been configured to convert these forms of character punctuation to old style safe ASCII LaTeX methods. If you would rather work in a modern UTF-8 environment where typographic punctuation is acceptable, you could remove or disable the conversions from the Replacements compile format pane.
Notation
If you opt to include inline annotations and comments in your output, they will be converted to marginal notes and highlights using LaTeX tools for doing so. You may also make use of Scrivener's footnote features, as they will be converted to syntax for you.
Creating an Index
To an include an index of terms, you will first need to enable the Indexing Packages front matter module, along with the Index itself in the back matter folder. To do so, visit these sections and enable the “Include in Compile” option in the inspector’s Metadata tab.
As for marking indexed terms themselves, you could of course do so by hand, but you can also make use of the Index Term and Index Key styles:
	◆	Use the “Index Term” style to mark the word or phrase, directly in the text, that you wish to add to the index. When compiled, a key based on the selected text will be generated for you.
	◆	Use the “Index Key” style if the phrase itself doesn’t appear in the text, or if you want direct control over the indexing key itself.

            <Comments>Given a quirk in how styles work with the text engine, you will need to select the image to see the "Figure" style, rather than merely placing the cursor to the left or right of it.</Comments>

            <Title>HP Turbine</Title>
            <Text>The simplified steam cycle uses a single turbine to extract power from the steam, but most ships use two turbines to do the same job. Two shorter turbine shafts are more advantageous than one large shaft for several reasons, including reduced manufacturing cost and increased flexibility in the arrangement of machinery in the engine room.

The first of these two turbines is known as the *high pressure turbine* (H.P.) and the second is the *low pressure turbine* (L.P.). A steam line, called the *crossover* carries steam from the outlet of the H.P. turbine to the inlet of the L.P. turbine. At normal operating speeds, the steam leaving the H.P. turbine and entering the crossover is at a pressure below atmospheric.

The H.P. and L.P. turbines together are known as the *Main Engine*.</Text>

            <Title>Bearings</Title>
            <Text>The turbine rotors must be supported at each end by bearings, which are provided to maintain both the radial and axial position of the rotor. Oil lubricated bearings are used. The bearings that maintain radial position are known as *journal* or *sleeve* bearings, and the bearings which maintain axial position are known as *thrust* bearings.

Bearings must be properly lubricated at all times when the turbine is rotating, or they will quickly be destroyed, and disable the main engine. It is critically important to maintain the bearing lubricating oil within the proper temperature range. Oil entering the bearing should be maintained between 110° to 120° F, and the oil will normally pick up about 20° to 40° as it cools and lubricates the bearing, depending on the main engine speed. High oil temperature is a sign of an impending problem such as: lubrication failure, plugged oil strainers, contaminated oil, or bearing failure. Under no circumstances should the oil leaving any turbine or gear bearing be allowed to exceed 180° F, or show a 50° F temperature rise across the bearing. At these temperatures limits, the bearing surface, which is made of a lead-tin alloy known as *babbit*, will begin to soften and melt, causing major rotor misalignment and machinery failure. If the bearing temperatures approach these limits, the main engine must be secured immediately. Thermometers and lubrication sight flow glasses are available at each of the main engine bearings, and they should be monitored carefully by watch standers at all times when the engine is in operation.</Text>

            <Title>Enthalpy</Title>
            <Text>When discussing a system involving work and heat, such as a boiler and turbine, you may hear the term *enthalpy.* Enthalpy is a thermodynamic quantity defined as the sum of internal energy and the work done by the substance to move its surroundings out of the way as it moves or expands, known as “flow work.” One consequence of this definition is that when heat flows into a substance at constant pressure, its enthalpy increases by the amount of heat energy added. This is why enthalpy is sometimes described as the “heat content” of a substance. Remember that heat is energy in transition, and is never stored so no substance ever really “contains” heat.</Text>

The superheater is a bank of boiler tubes located in the hottest portions of the combustion gas path. Since there is no liquid water in the superheater, all heat added there is sensible heat. It is important to always maintain a flow of steam through the superheater tubes, or else the tubes would quickly overheat and melt.</Text>

            <Text>Chemicals that are improperly stored or incompatible substances stored in close proximity can react with one another, causing fires, explosions, or the release of toxic gases. Inadequate storage practices may also result in spills, leaks, or contamination, endangering both employees and the environment. 
It is essential to follow proper storage procedures, including segregating incompatible chemicals, labeling containers correctly, ensuring proper ventilation and temperature control, and implementing appropriate containment measures such as spill kits and secondary containment systems.  The MSDS will contain instructions regarding proper storage.
In particular, aboard ship chemical containers must always be secured so that they don’t break free and cause accidents during heavy weather.   </Text>

            <Title>Centrifugal Pump Design</Title>
            <Text>Centrifugal pumps come in two basic designs, volute and diffuser, and many variations, including: single or double-suction, single or multiple stages, and horizontal or vertical layout.

In the *volute* pump, the one most commonly used, the impeller discharges into a progressively expanding casing, as shown in Figref(centpump.png). The casing is proportioned to produce equal velocity of flow all around the circumference of the casing and then gradually to reduce the velocity as the liquid passes from the casing into the nozzle to be discharged from the pump, thereby transforming a considerable part of the velocity head into pressure head.

Fig: pumps/diffusertype.png "Diffuser Type Centrifugal Pump" class=left

In the *diffuser* pump, the impeller is surrounded by gradually expanding passages formed by stationary guide vanes, sometimes called a diffusion ring, as shown in Figref(diffusertype.png). In these expanding passages the direction of flow is changed and velocity largely converted to pressure before the liquid enters the volute. It is worth noting that the diffuser vanes are set approximately tangent to the ends of the impeller blades. In this kind of casing, efficiency may be slightly higher than in volute pumps, since velocity is more completely converted into pressure. The added cost of manufacture and more complicated construction of diffuser pumps, however, is generally not considered justified except occasionally in the case of large high pressure pumps. 

Fig: pumps/impellers.png "Impellers" class=right

The impellers used in volute and diffuser pumps are of three kinds, *open*, *semi-open*, and *enclosed* as shown in Figref(impellers.png). The open impeller consists only of blades attached to a hub. The semi-open impeller is constructed with a circular plate, called the web, on the inside edge of the blades. The web need not extend all the way out to the ends of the blades. The use of a web makes it possible to use thinner blades. In the case of the enclosed impeller, a shroud is added on the outside edge of the blades, so that the liquid is in large measure confined in the blade region, between the web and the shroud. Holding the liquid between these plates reduces friction losses in the pump. Open and semi-open impellers are normally found in pumps that must handle relatively large solids in the liquid, such as sewage pumps.

Impellers may also be *single* or *double-suction*. The former consists of a single impeller drawing liquid in from one side through one eye, while the double suction impeller is similar to a pair of single suction impellers placed back to back, placing an eye on each side of the impeller so that the liquid is drawn into the impeller from opposite directions. Double suction impellers can handle greater capacities of liquid than a single suction impeller of the same size and operating speed. This is because the larger inlet area of the two suction eyes provides less resistance to liquid flow into the impeller. 

Fig: pumps/doublesuction.png "Double Suction Pump" class=left

*Single stage* pumps contain only one impeller, drawing in the liquid and expelling it through the discharge into the liquid system. A double-suction, single-stage pump is shown in Figref(doublesuction.png). A disadvantage of the single-stage pump, however, is that discharge pressure cannot be increased above the maximum working pressure of the impeller design operating at a given speed. Above this limit, under practical working conditions, the pump will not deliver any further increase in pressure. Most volute type, single stage pumps do not operate at speeds in excess of 3600 RPM and typically produce maximum discharge pressures in the 150 to 200 psi range. Diffuser type, single stage pumps may operate at speeds as high as 8000 RPM and produce discharge pressures in excess of 1000 psi; turbine driven boiler feed pumps are sometimes this type.

In *multistage* pumps, this disadvantage is overcome by combining several single-stage pumps, whether single or double suction, so that the discharge of one impeller is delivered to the suction of the next impeller. The liquid is delivered to each succeeding stage under the pressure imparted to it by the preceding stage, and additional velocity and pressure are added. As the liquid passes through each impeller in turn, additional pressure is imparted to it. A much higher working head can be produced than is possible with a single impeller. For the sake of compactness the several impellers of multistage pumps are almost invariably placed on one shaft, and the whole unit is built into one housing. The impellers are arranged in multistage pumps to eliminate or minimize end thrust.

Both volute and diffuser pumps will be found in single and multi-stage construction. Because of the greater cost and complexity of diffuser pumps, they are rarely used.

The pump itself can have a *vertical* or *horizontal* layout, determined by the direction of the pump shaft axis when the pump is installed. Horizontal designs, in most applications, are easier for maintenance personnel to work on, while vertical designs require less floor space for installation. Both designs work equally well.</Text>

            <Title>Turbine Design</Title>
            <Text>A steam turbine consists of *nozzles* through which steam passes, and a *rotor* which carries moving turbine *blades*, also known as *buckets*. The steam which flows from the nozzles creates a force on the blades, which spins the rotor. Most turbines have several rows of blades and multiple nozzles to fully utilize the energy and momentum of the steam. The nozzles, rotor and steam are all contained within a cylindrical turbine casing, or *barrel*. Throttle valves and governors are provided to control the flow of steam to the turbine, and ultimately, the speed and power produced.

There are two fundamental methods used to convert the thermal energy of steam into mechanical work in a turbine: impulse and reaction. These two principles are illustrated in Figref(basic.png), however commercial turbines do not actually resemble these models. In an *Impulse* turbine, high velocity steam from a nozzle slams into the turbine blades to create an impulse, or quick push, on the rotor, while in a *reaction* turbine, the kick which is developed when steam passes through a rotating nozzle creates the turning force. Turbines manufactured by General Electric are primarily impulse, while turbines manufactured by Westinghouse are primarily reaction. 

Fig: turbines/basic.png "Simple Turbines" class=left 

A *nozzle* is a specially shaped restriction in a fluid stream which causes the fluid’s velocity to increase while decreasing the fluid's pressure. The nozzle converts the pressure energy of the fluid into kinetic energy. A suicide-type fire hose nozzle is a good example, although a nozzle for steam, which is compressible, has a converging-diverging shape rather than a simple taper. Low velocity, high pressure water in the fire hose emerges from the nozzle as a high velocity stream reduced to atmospheric pressure. If a friend points a fire hose towards you, the force you feel from the water stream is similar to the impulse on the turbine blades, while the force he feels trying to control the nozzle is a reaction force.</Text>

            <Text>The safety hat or cap in Class C is designed specifically for lightweight comfort and impact protection and is sometimes known as a bump cap. Class C helmets are used on occasions where there is a possibility of bumping the head against a fixed object and no danger from falling objects or electrical shock. Bump caps can be worn for protection against scalp lacerations from contact with sharp objects. However, they are not substitutes for safety caps/hats because they do not afford protection from high impact forces or penetration by falling objects.</Text>

            <Text>Fig: boilers/safetyvalve.png "Safety Valve" width=400px

The boiler is equipped with three safety valves, similar to the one shown in Figref(safetyvalve.png) Two are located on the steam drum, and one on the superheater outlet pipe. The safety valve outlets are connected to the *sky pipe* which discharges outside the engine room up the smokestack. The safety valves are set to open if the boiler pressure becomes too high. The superheater safety valve is adjusted to the lowest opening pressure, so it will open first, followed by the two drum safeties. It is important that the superheater safety valve opens first, because if the drum safety valve opened first, there would be a disruption of the flow of steam through the superheater, which would cause it to overheat.</Text>

            <Text>Fig: valves/Checkvalve_views.png "Check Valves"

A check valve is a modified globe valve that allows fluid flow in one direction only, through a pipe line and automatically stops flow in the opposite direction. A check valve has two basic parts: the *body* which is similar to the body of a globe valve – with one seat, two external pipe connections, and an opening for the bonnet to attach to; and the *Cover* or *Cap* which replaces the globe valve bonnet assembly and fastens to the body using the same methods used to attach bonnets on globe valves. However, the cap is a blank cover with no hand operators, stuffing box or valve stem.

There are three main variations of check valves: swing checks, lift checks, and stop checks, and they are discussed below.</Text>

            <Text>The diagram shown in Figref(ts.png) is an idealized representation of the Rankine Cycle used in the study of thermodynamics, and known as a Temperature-entropy diagram. The heavy dome shaped curve is known as the *vapor dome* and points under the curve are saturated steam, while points to the left of the curve are liquid water and points to the right of the curve are superheated steam.

Feedwater enters the boiler at point  \\(1\\), and is heated by the fuel. Initially, the water temperature rises, until it reaches the saturation temperature for the boiler pressure, point \\(1_f\\), where the water begins to boil. Additional heat added at this point does not raise the temperature any further until all the liquid water is completely vaporized, point  \\(1_g\\). The heat added between  \\(1_f\\) and  \\(1_g\\) is the *Latent Heat of Vaporization*. After the steam has reached point  \\(1_g\\), any additional heat added causes the temperature to rise again, and the steam becomes superheated.

Fig: steamcycle/ts.png "Temperature - Entropy Diagram"

Superheated steam leaves the boiler at point  \\(2\\) and enters the turbine. During the expansion process, the steam pressure and temperature both drop as energy is extracted from the steam. Steam leaves the turbine and enters the condenser at point  \\(3\\), which is saturated or wet steam.

In the condenser, heat is removed from the steam and it returns to the liquid state at point  \\(4\\). The feed pump raises the water pressure back up to the boiler pressure and the cycle begins again at point  \\(1\\). The feed pump causes a small temperature rise in the feedwater as well as a pressure increase.

The area under the curve from  \\(1\\) to  \\(2\\) represents the heat energy added in the boiler and the area under the curve from  \\(3\\) to  \\(4\\) represents the heat rejected to the ocean. The area inside the curve represents the net work done by the cycle.</Text>

            <Title>Pressure Conversions</Title>
            <Text>In interpreting pressure measurements, a great deal of confusion arises because the zero point on most pressure gages represents atmospheric pressure rather than zero absolute pressure, and both pressure and head scales are used. Thus it is important to specify the kind of pressure being measured under given conditions. To clarify the numerous meanings of the word pressure, the relationship among gage pressure, atmospheric pressure, vacuum, and absolute pressure is illustrated in Figref(PressureRelations.png).

Fig: thermo/PressureRelations.png "Pressure Relationship" width=500px


If you can remember the following facts, it is relatively easy to
perform unit conversions between the various pressure scales.

-   Atmospheric pressure equivalents: 

	\\[14.7 \textrm{ psi} = 29.92 \textrm{ in Hg} = 760 \textrm{ mm Hg} = 34 \textrm{ ft H}_2\textrm{O} = 101.3 \textrm{ kPa} = 1.01 \textrm{ bar} \\]

-   Absolute scales measure up from zero

-   Gage scales measure up or down from atmospheric pressure

-   Vacuum scales measure down from atmospheric pressure

**Example** Convert from 10.4 psia to mm Hg Vacuum

1.  Set up a ratio to convert psia to mm Hg Absolute

    \\[ \frac{10.4 \textrm{ psia}}{14.7 \textrm{ psia}} = \frac{p}{760 \textrm{ mm Hg} }\\]
	\\[ p = 537.7 \textrm{ mm Hg (absolute)} \\]

2.  Subtract from atmospheric pressure to get vacuum

    \\[ V = 760 - p = 222.3 \textrm{ mm Hg (vacuum)} \\]</Text>

            <Text>Fig: valves/Bonnet_Styles.png "Types of Bonnets" width=7in

The bonnet houses the equipment necessary to operate the gate and is attached and sealed to the body using the same methods as on globe valves.

Gate valves are available in different types of stem connections. Figref(Bonnet_Styles.png) illustrates three different types.

1.  Non-rising stem, inside screw (A)

    The stem screws down into the valve gate as the valve is opened. In this type the stem does not rise or fall outside the valve body as  the valve is opened or closed, it simply rotates.

2.  Rising stem, inside screw (B)

    The stem rises outside the valve as the valve is opened, but the stem screw operates inside the body of the valve. When operated, the  valve stem in this design rises and rotates.

3.  Rising stem, outside screw and yoke (C)

    The stem screw operates at the level of the hand-wheel, so the stem rises independently of the hand-wheel as the valve is opened. The  valve stem rises, but does not rotate. Instead of the valve stem  rotating, the hand-wheel rotates the yoke bushing pulling the stem  straight up. Valve stem threads can be easily cleaned and lubricated  in this design.

    Outside screw and yoke design is required on gate valves when diameters exceed 3" and pressures exceed 600 psig.

Notice that in both type A and B, the stem threads are exposed to the fluids flowing through the valve. Fluids can eventually corrode the threads and fluids with solids entrained can cause the threads to bind up and create excessive wear.

Valves with rising stems are used when it is important to know by immediate inspection whether the valve is opened or closed. The outside screw and yoke type easily indicates valve position due to the stem extending out beyond the center of the valve wheel when it is open.

The non-rising type is the least likely to leak in the packing area and requires less installation space.</Text>

            <Title>Plug Valves</Title>
            <Text>Plug valves, Figref(plugvalve.png), have a through-ported cylindrical or tapered plug which can rotate in a close-fitting body. Alignment of the ports (holes) in the plug with those in the body permit fluid flow.

Operation of a plug valve requires rotating the handle or lever on the plug stem 90 degrees. Normally the plug valves (for the most common type with two pipe connections 180 degrees apart) position (open or closed) can be determined by looking at the operating lever. When the lever is parallel to the piping system, the valve is open. When the lever is perpendicular to the piping system, the valve is closed.

Plugs valves have limited throttling ability and should be used like gate valves, either fully open or closed.

Plug valves may be built with multiple openings in the plug and multiple ports in the valve body. These designs allow a variety of fluid flow directions through the plug valve by proper positioning of the operating lever. Pointers attached to the plug stem or operating lever are sometimes used to indicate direction of flow.

When a plug valve is described as "three-way, two-port" it means the valve body has three openings to pipe connections on the outside of the body. Two port means the plug has two openings in it that fluid flows in and out through.</Text>

            <Title>Head[pressurehead]</Title>
            <Text>*Head* is defined as the vertical distance between two liquid levels. Head, for a pump, is simply the distance, measured in “feet of fresh water,” between the pump suction connection centerline and the liquid level in the supply tank, or between the pump discharge connection centerline and the liquid level in the discharge tank. Static head in feet can be related to the pressure that the pump must generate in the fluid to create these differences in liquid levels. Static head also influences the output capacity of the pump.

When discussing pumps, we are always referring to *static head*. In other engineering courses, you will learn about other types of head. For example, in Fluid Mechanics, you will calculate the pressure necessary to overcome friction in the pipelines, called *friction head*, and the pressure required to impart velocity to the fluid, known as *velocity head*.

Fig: pumps/static_head.png "Static Pump Head"

Head can also be thought of as the pressure necessary to support a column of water of a height equal to the head. Since head can be related to pressure, you may be wondering how atmospheric pressure effects the pump. Usually there is no effect at all. Since atmospheric pressure acts on the surface of the liquid in both the suction and discharge tanks, the effect is equal but in opposite directions on each side of the pump, and the result is that the net effect of the atmospheric pressure on the pump, is canceled out.

Several different head measurements are used to describe the operation of a pump. The relationship between these heads is illustrated in Figref(static_head.png).</Text>

            <Title>Boiler Circulation</Title>
            <Text>It is important to understand the flow paths of water, steam, air and combustion gases through the boiler. This circulation is illustrated in Figref(boilersteamflow.png). 

Fig: boilers/boilersteamflow.png "Boiler Steam and Water Flow Paths"

The process begins when feedwater is discharged from the feed pump, passes through the feedwater control valve, enters the economizer inlet header and flows through the economizer tubes to the outlet. The feedwater picks up about 100 to 200° of sensible heat in the economizer and exits at about 350 °F.

The Feedwater leaves the economizer and enters the steam drum via the internal feed pipe. The feed pipe distributes the water evenly along the length of the steam drum. The coolest and densest water flows down through the downcomers, and perhaps some of the waterwall tubes, screen tubes and generating tubes, to the water drum and lower headers. From there the water is distributed to the various tubes and replaces the water which has turned to steam.

The water in the generating tubes is exposed to the combustion gases through heat transfer across the tube walls. This increases the water temperature and decreases its density, causing it to rise upward. The water temperature increases until it reaches the saturation temperature of 486 °F, at which point steam bubbles begin to form. These bubbles are saturated steam, and they rise up and enter the steam drum, carrying liquid water along with them.

In the steam drum, the water-steam mixture enters the cyclone separators which removes the excess water from the steam by centrifugal action. Separated water falls back to the steam drum above the baffle plates, while the steam enters the dry pipe. From there the steam flows out of the steam drum and into the superheater header.

From the superheater header, the steam is directed into the superheater tubes, where it makes several passes through the furnace, increasing the steam temperature to approximately 850 °F, and then it exits through the outlet header.

Superheated steam leaves the outlet header and flows to the one of three places: the main engine, the turbogenerators, or back into the boiler. The portion returning to the boiler enters the desuperheater, which is a pipe submerged below the water level in the steam drum. There the steam cools back down to near its saturation temperature, flows out through the auxiliary steam stop valve, and on to all the remaining steam consumers on the ship.

At the same time this is occurring, air from the engine room is being drawn in by the forced draft fans, blown across the tubes of the steam air heater and down through the space between the inner and outer casing. This air then passes through the register air doors and into the furnace. Here it meets with the finely atomized fuel droplets, which quickly heat up to their ignition temperature and burn.

The resulting combustion gases, under a slight pressure due to the forced draft fans, pass across the boiler tubes; first the screen tubes, then the superheater tubes, the generating tubes, and finally the economizer tubes, before leaving the boiler up the stack.</Text>

            <Title>Types of Safety Shoes</Title>
            <Text>**Safety Shoes and Boots.** Safety shoes and boots are available in many styles depending on the job requirements. Boots provide more protection than shoes from chemicals and molten metals splashes and spark hazards, but they are heavier. Some protective features that are available in both boots and shoes include:

-   Oil resistant shoes
-   Chemical resistant shoes
-   Heat resistant shoes
-   Slip and skid resistant shoes
-   Waterproof and water resistant shoes

**Steel-Reinforced Safety Shoes and Boots.** Similar to safety shoes, these have the toe box and insole reinforced with steel, and the instep reinforced with steel, aluminum, or plastic. These shoes will protect your feet from falling objects and puncture injuries.

**Electrically Insulated Safety Shoes.** These shoes have non-conductive soles to prevent the wearer’s feet from completing an electrical circuit to ground. They can protect workers against as much as 600 volts in dry conditions. These shoes should be used in conjunction with insulated tools and precautions to reduce or eliminate the potential for providing a path for hazardous electrical energy. Non-conductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations; in such locations, electrically conductive shoes are required.

**Electrically Conductive Safety Shoes.** These shoes protect against the buildup of static electricity. Essentially, these shoes ground the employees wearing them. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on an employee’s body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. During training, employees must be instructed not to use foot powder or wear socks made of silk, wool, or nylon with conductive shoes. Foot powder insulates and retards the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool, and nylon produce static electricity. Conductive shoes are not general-purpose shoes and must be removed upon completion of the tasks for which they are required. Employees exposed to electrical hazards must *never* wear conductive shoes.</Text>

            <Title>Absolute Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Pressure measured on a scale increasing from zero at a perfect vacuum is known as absolute pressure. Absolute pressure is always higher than the corresponding gage pressure by the amount of the atmospheric pressure. For shipboard purposes, you can simply add 14.7 psi to the gage reading in psi to get the absolute pressure. For example, a gage pressure of 100 psig would be the same as an absolute pressure of 114.7 psia.

We sometimes say psig to indicate gage pressure and other times we merely say psi. By common convention, gage pressure is always assumed when pressure is given in pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, or similar units. The "g" (for gage) is added only when there is some possibility of confusion. Absolute pressure, on the other hand, is always expressed as pounds per square inch absolute (psia), pounds per square foot absolute (psfa), and so forth. It is always necessary to establish clearly just what kind of pressure we are talking about, unless this is very clear from the nature of the discussion.</Text>

            <Title>Gear Pumps</Title>
            <Text>
Fig: pumps/gear_pump.png "Gear Pump" class=left 

Gear pumps are probably the most common type of rotary pump, and Figref(gear_pump.png) illustrates a typical example. The liquid is carried from the suction to the discharge in the spaces between the gear teeth and the surface of the pump casing as the gears rotate. One of the gears is directly driven by the source of power, while the other, called the *idler gear* rotates with it in the opposite direction. This is accomplished either because motion is imparted from the drive gear to the idler gear by the meshing of the two gears at the center of the pump chamber, or because *timing gears* outside the pump chamber transmit motion from one gear shaft to the other.

There are close clearances between the gear teeth and the pump casing, and between the teeth of the two gears at their point of contact where they form a continuous fluid-tight joint. As the gears rotate in the direction indicated by the arrows, liquid is trapped in turn between each pair of teeth and the casing and carried away from the suction side of the pump. At the same time, as the teeth unmesh at the center of the pump chamber, a low pressure is left in the empty space between the gear teeth. Liquid flows in to fill the low pressure areas between the gear teeth. As the gear teeth remesh on the discharge side of the pump, the liquid in between the gear teeth is forced out, eventually flowing to the discharge connection on the pump casing.

Three kinds of true gears are used: spur, helical and herringbone. Spur and helical gear pumps can be rotated in the opposite direction to reverse the flow through the pump while generally that is not possible with the herringbone design. When the latter is rotated in the wrong direction, liquid is trapped in the middle of the “V” resulting in pressure strains on the shafts and bearings.

The herringbone gear pump utilizes gears with a very steep “V” shape to the gear teeth. These designs are employed when very smooth discharge is desired. The steep angle on the gear teeth, however; prevents the gear driven by an outside source from turning the idler gear. The steep angle causes the gear teeth to jam together rather than rotate freely. Rotary motion is transmitted to the idler shaft via a set of timing gears instead. The timing gears prevent driving contact between pumping gears to eliminate the jamming problem.</Text>

            <Title>Foot Protection</Title>
            <Text>Your feet are vulnerable to many potential hazards aboard ship. For example, slips and falls due to wet and slippery decks; heavy objects falling on or rolling over your foot because of the ship’s motion or accident; punctures caused by stepping on sharp objects; and potential electrical shock when your body is grounded through the soles of your shoes. In other industries, there are other hazards to consider, chemical exposure, high temperatures, molten metal splashes, static electricity, to name a few. Proper selection of footwear can minimize the danger of these hazards.

OSHA has established regulations for safety shoe design, including impact and compression strength requirements, and they have mandated footwear requirements for many industries. For example, safety shoes or boots with impact protection are required to be worn in work areas where carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection are required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual materials handling cars) or other activities in which materials or equipment could potentially roll over an employee’s feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection are required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a foot injury. Although there are no specific OSHA requirements for safety footwear for marine engineers, it is nonetheless sensible to select and wear safety shoes based on the hazards found in the engine room.</Text>

            <Title>Power</Title>
            <Text>*Power* is the rate of doing work. The amount of work done has nothing at all to do with how long it takes to do it. When you lift a weight of 1 pound through a distance of 1 foot, you have done 1 foot-pound of work, regardless of whether you do it in half a second or half an hour. A device which can do a lot of work quickly is powerful. The common unit of measurement for power is the *horsepower* (hp). By definition, 1 horsepower is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute or 550 foot-pounds of work per second. Thus a machine that is capable of doing 550 foot-pounds of work per second is said to be a 1-horsepower machine. (As you can see, your horsepower rating would not be very impressive if you did 1 foot-pound of work in half an hour. Figure it out. It works out to be just a little more than one-millionth of a horsepower.)</Text>

            <Title>Throttles</Title>
            <Text>The throttle valves are the primary valves used to control the amount of steam allowed to enter the turbines, and hence they control the speed of the ship. Previously, throttle valves were manually operated by the engineer on watch in response to bell commands from the bridge, but today the throttles may be controlled by the mate on the bridge by remote control.

There are two throttles, the ahead throttle, and the astern throttle. The ahead throttle controls steam to the high pressure turbine and controls the speed of the ship in the ahead (forward) direction. If the ahead throttle is closed, and the astern throttle is opened, steam will be directed to the astern section of the low pressure turbine. Blades in this section are arranged so that they cause the turbine to rotate in the opposite direction and reverse the propeller.

The ahead throttle and the astern throttle should not be opened at the same time, because this would cause two opposing torques on the low pressure turbine rotor. While this would not necessarily be damaging, it would be a colossal waste of energy. The *Astern Guardian Valve* is installed in the astern steam line between the astern throttle and the astern turbine to protect against leakage of the astern throttle while the ship is underway. This valve normally remains closed, and is only opened when the ship is expected to maneuver.</Text>

            <Title>Steam Pressure and Temperature</Title>
            <Text>Steam pressure and temperature are important parameters to watch while the boiler is operating. Obviously, the purpose of the boiler is to produce steam at the correct pressure and temperature to be used by the main engine and auxiliary machinery. Under normal conditions these values are maintained by the combustion control system and should be relatively steady. A rising or falling steam value is a sure indication of an impending problem. You should carefully observe the normal operating range for the drum and superheater outlet pressures, and notify the engineer or take corrective action if these values deviate from normal.

High steam pressure, if left unchecked will lead to the superheater safety valves lifting. Properly designed and maintained safety valves are capable of relieving the entire boiler to prevent a boiler explosion, but they should never have to open on a properly operated boiler. Low steam pressure will cause a loss of power at the main engines and generators. Failure to respond will lead to electrical blackout of the ship and loss of propulsion power. Incorrect superheat temperature is less harmful than incorrect steam pressure, but you should still note it and correct it if possible. High and low superheat temperatures often indicates another problem with the boiler such as dirty burners, excess air, or incorrect feed temperatures. On ships with controlled superheat, the superheater temperature control system may be faulty.</Text>

            <Text>Can you define energy? Although everyone has a general idea of the meaning of energy, a good definition is hard to find. Most commonly, perhaps, energy is defined as the “ability of a system to do work.” This is not a very complete definition. Energy can produce other effects which cannot possibly be considered “work.” For example, heat can flow from one object to another without doing work; yet heat is a form of energy, and the process of heat transfer is a process that produces an effect.

A better definition of energy, therefore, states that “energy is the capacity for producing an effect.”  Energy exists in many forms. For convenience, we usually classify energy according to the size and nature of the bodies or particles with which it is associated. Thus we say that *Mechanical energy* is the energy associated with large bodies or objects, usually, things that are big enough to see. *Thermal energy* is energy associated with molecules. *Chemical energy* is energy that arises from the forces which bind the atoms together in a molecule, Chemical energy is demonstrated whenever combustion or any other chemical reaction takes place. *Electro-magnetic* energy is energy that is associated with the electron and charged particles. Light, x-rays and radio waves are examples of electro-magnetic energy. *Nuclear energy* is associated with the particles in the nucleus, and is governed by Einstein's famous equation \\(E = mc^2\\)

Each of these types of energy (mechanical energy, thermal energy, etc.) must also be classified as being either stored energy, or energy in transition. 

*Stored energy* can be thought of as energy that is actually “contained in” or “stored in” a substance or system. There are two kinds of stored energy: potential energy, and kinetic energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the relative *positions* of two or more objects or particles, we call it potential energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the relative *velocities* of two or more objects or particles, we call it kinetic energy.

            <Title>Pressure[pressdef]</Title>
            <Text>Pressure is defined as force per unit area. That is, a force acting over an area is a pressure, and when you multiply a pressure by the area that it acts over, you get a force. &lt;me&gt; P = \frac{F}{A} &lt;/me&gt;
Many different units are used to describe pressure. The simplest pressure units are ones that indicate how much force is applied to an area of a certain size. These units include pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, newtons per square meter, kilopascals, bars or others depending upon the system being used. Aboard ship we most commonly use pounds per square inch (psi).</Text>

            <Title>Extractions</Title>
            <Text>Partially expanded steam can be taken from these turbines at four points for heating condensate and feedwater in the steam cycle, and for other uses such as auxiliary steam and evaporator heating. This steam is known as *extraction* steam or *bleed* steam.

Two bleed points are located after the second and fourth stages in the HP turbine, another at the crossover pipe, and the last in the LP turbine. The steam pressure available at these points depends on the turbine load; higher steam pressures are available when the turbine is heavily loaded than when it is lightly loaded. Bleed steam is not available when the turbine is stopped or operating astern.

An interesting feature of the *Patriot State* turbine was that the crossover extraction was connected to the auxiliary exhaust system. Under certain load conditions, such as when the cargo refrigeration turbines were in operation, there would be an excess of auxiliary exhaust steam. Rather than wasting this excess exhaust, it was returned to the turbine at the crossover to assist turning the LP turbine. Under these circumstances, the crossover was used for *steam induction* rather than *steam extraction*.</Text>

            <Title>Heat Transfer</Title>
            <Text>Heat can flow from one substance to another only when a temperature difference exists. Heat flow can occur only from a higher temperature to a lower temperature. When two objects at different temperatures are placed in contact with each other (or near each other), heat flows from the warmer object to the cooler one until both are at the same temperature. Heat transfer occurs at a faster rate when there is a larger temperature difference between the two objects. As the temperature difference approaches zero, the rate of heat transfer approaches zero.

Conduction, radiation, and convection are usually considered to be the three methods by which heat transfer can occur. It is more accurate, however, to consider conduction and radiation as the two basic methods of heat transfer and to consider convection separately as a special process which involves movement within a mass of fluid.</Text>

            <Title>Operation[ops1]</Title>
            <Text>In this section you will find a brief description of the fluid flow paths through the Deaerator, as well as some considerations for the watch engineer as he operates the unit.

**Water Flow.** The condensate enters the tank through the tubes of the vent condenser at the top and is forced out through a number of stainless steel spray valves. The spray valves discharge the condensate in a fine conical spray throughout the steam filled upper preheater section of the tank. Most of the corrosive gases are removed here before the water strikes steel surfaces. This hot and partially deaerated water along with any condensed steam, drains down the conical baffle and into the deaerating unit, where it is vigorously scrubbed and heated by the entering oxygen-free steam. The thoroughly deaerated water then falls into the storage section in the bottom half of the tank. It remains there until it is pumped to the boiler by the feed pump.

**Steam Flow.** Auxiliary Exhaust Steam is used as the heating medium for the DC Heater. The pressure of the exhaust steam establishes pressure inside the DC Heater, and the temperature is the corresponding saturation pressure. For example, a plant operating with 33 psi auxiliary exhaust steam would produce feedwater at 270° F. A different exhaust pressure would mean a correspondingly different temperature, which can be determined from the saturated steam table.

Steam enters the deaerating unit through a check valve, and collides at high velocity with the heated and partially deaerated water in the scrubber section where it picks up the water and throws it tangentially outward through the curved baffles. In this process, the water is thoroughly scrubbed by the new incoming steam. As the steam gives up heat to the water most of it condenses. The condensate and condensed steam fall to a storage area, while the uncondensed steam and air rise up to heat the water in the preheating section.

**Air Flow.** Air and non-condensibles liberated in the scrubber and preheater sections, along with some entrained steam, rise up to the top of the DC Heater where they pass over the relatively cool tubes of the vent condenser. Here, most of the remaining steam is condensed and recovered. The remaining air and non-condensible gases accompanied by a tiny wisp of steam are discharged from the vent condenser, either directly to the atmosphere or to the gland exhaust condenser.

**Flashing Feed Pump.** The pressure in the shell of the DC Heater is the same as the pressure of the auxiliary exhaust steam used to heat it. Since a mixture of steam and water exists in the heater, the water temperature there will be approximately equal to the saturation temperature of steam at that pressure. This is necessary to achieve good deaeration, but it can lead to a problem.

The pressure at the suction of the feed pump depends on the pressure in the DC Heater and the vertical distance between the pump and the DC Heater. But as the feedwater flows to the feed pump, any slight pressure drop, for example caused by line friction or bends, will reduce the feedwater pressure below its saturation pressure and cause it to flash to steam. Since a centrifugal pump cannot pump a vapor, the feed pump will be unable to deliver water to the boiler and may overspeed and trip off the line. To avoid this, in merchant ships the DC Heater is always located high in the engine room and the feed pump low. This maximizes the weight of the water in the feed line, which raises the pressure, (technically the NPSH - *Net Positive Suction Head*), at the inlet of the feed pump. Every foot of head raises the water pressure by 0.433 psi, so a 45 foot difference in elevations between the DC Heater and the feed pump causes the feed pressure at the suction of the pump to be about 19 psi greater than the pressure in the DC Heater, which is normally sufficient to prevent flashing. Operators must take care not to let the water level in the DC Heater or the Auxiliary Exhaust Steam pressure fall too low, since both of these problems may lead to feed pump flashing.

In naval ships, it is often impossible to locate the DC Heater high in the engine room because of the compact design of the machinery spaces, so these plants are equipped with a *feed booster pump* between the DC Heater and the main feed pump. The booster pump raises the pressure of the feedwater and maintains a constant pressure at the suction of the feed pump to prevent flashing.

**Make Up Feed (MUF).** One of the functions of the DC Heater in the steam cycle is to store water. Water is also stored in two other locations in the steam cycle, the steam drum, and the main condenser hotwell. If the steam drum level and the hotwell level are constant, as they normally should be, then as water is added to or lost by the steam cycle, the level of the DC Heater will change. Because of leaks and losses in the system, the DC Heater level will normally fall slowly during the course of the day, and must be monitored by the watch officer. When the level falls, it is necessary to add *make-up feed* to replenish the system.

Make-up feed is stored in the make-up feed tanks or the reserve feed tanks and added to the steam cycle by vacuum drag into one of the condensers. When the ship is at sea, the main condenser is usually used. In port, with the main engine shut down, one of the auxiliary condensers would be used instead. On modern ships, the control of the make-up feed and the level in the DC Heater are maintained automatically, but it may be necessary for the watch engineer to take over and add make-up feed manually if the regulator fails.

Occasionally the level in the DC Heater gets too high. This should not happen, but if it does it must be lowered back to normal. The condensate system is fitted with a valve and line which exits the steam cycle and starves the DC Heater of water. This line directs the discharge of the condensate pump to a reserve feed tank, instead of the DC Heater, until the level comes down. This is sometimes referred to as dumping the DC Heater or DC Heater starvation.

When taking on make-up feed, you must take care not to introduce too much cold water into the DC Heater too fast. If you do, you may overwhelm the ability of the auxiliary exhaust steam line to supply enough steam to maintain the pressure in the DC Heater. All of the entering steam will immediately condense, and the result will be a rapid drop in the shell pressure of the DC Heater, which will lead to a drop in pressure at the suction of the feed pump and possible flashing and overspeeding. This same problem can occur when you use a condensate pump to pump out the hotwell of an idle condenser.</Text>

            <Title>The Generation of Steam</Title>
            <Text>When a liquid boils, it generates a vapor, that is, some or all of the liquid changes its physical state from liquid to gas (or vapor). As long as the vapor is in contact with the liquid from which it is being generated, it remains at the same temperature as the boiling liquid. In this condition, the liquid and its vapor are said to be in *equilibrium contact* with each other.

The temperature at which a boiling liquid and its vapor may exist in equilibrium contact depends on the pressure under which the process takes place. As the pressure increases, the boiling temperature increases. As the pressure decreases, the boiling temperature decreases. For each liquid, therefore, the boiling point is determined by the pressure.

When a liquid is boiling and generating vapor, the liquid is called a *saturated liquid*, and the vapor is called a *saturated vapor*. The temperature at which a liquid boils under a given pressure is called the *saturation temperature*, and the corresponding pressure is called the *saturation pressure*. For each pressure there is a corresponding saturation temperature, and for each temperature there is a corresponding saturation pressure. A few saturation pressures and temperatures for water are listed below.

Atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia at sea level and lesser at higher altitudes. Trying to cook potatoes at the top of a high mountain takes a great deal longer than it would at sea level. Why is this? As noted before, temperature and pressure are indications of internal energy. Since it is not possible to raise the temperature of the boiling water above the saturation temperature for that pressure, the amount of internal energy available for cooking the potatoes is much less at high altitudes than it is at sea level. By the same line of reasoning, you should be able to figure out why the potatoes cook faster in a pressure cooker than in an open kettle.

A peculiar thing happens to water and steam at an absolute pressure of 3206.2 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature at 705.40 °F. At this point, which is called the *critical point,* the vapor and the liquid are indistinguishable. No change of state occurs when the pressure is increased above this point or when heat is added. At the critical point, we can no longer refer to “water” or “steam,” since we cannot tell the water and steam apart. Instead, the substance is merely called a “fluid” or a “working substance.” Boilers designed to operate at pressures and temperatures above the critical point are called *supercritical* boilers. Supercritical boilers are not used, at present, in propulsion plants of ships; however, some boilers of this type are used in stationary steam power plants.

If we generate steam by boiling water in an open pan at atmospheric pressure, the water and the steam which is in immediate contact with the water will remain at 212 °F until all the water has been evaporated. If we fit an absolutely tight cover to the pan, so that no steam can escape while we continue to add heat, both the pressure and the temperature inside the vessel will rise. The steam and water will both increase in temperature and pressure, and each fluid will be at the same temperature and pressure as the other.

In operation, a boiler is neither an open vessel nor a closed vessel. Instead, it is a vessel designed with restricted openings which allow steam to escape at a uniform rate while feedwater is being brought in at a uniform rate. After boiler operating pressure has been reached, therefore, the process of steam generation in a boiler takes place at constant pressure and constant temperature, if we disregard any fluctuations that may be caused by changes in steam demands.

Although it is impossible to raise the temperature of the steam in the steam drum above the temperature of the water from which it is being generated, we can raise the temperature of the steam if we first remove the steam from contact with the water inside the steam drum and then add heat. Steam which has been heated above its saturation temperature for any given pressure is called *superheated steam*, and the vessel in which the saturated steam is superheated is called a *superheater.*

The amount by which the temperature of the superheated steam exceeds the temperature of saturated steam at the same pressure is known as the *degree of superheat*. For example, if saturated steam at a pressure of 620 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature of 490 °F is superheated to 790 °F, the degree of superheat is 300 °F.

All ship’s propulsion boilers are equipped with superheaters. The primary advantage is that superheating the steam provides a greater temperature differential between the boiler and the condenser, thus allowing more heat to be converted to work at the turbines. Another advantage is that superheated steam is dry and therefore causes relatively little corrosion or erosion of machinery and piping. Also, superheated steam does not conduct heat as rapidly (and therefore does not lose heat as rapidly) as saturated steam. The increased efficiency which results from the use of superheated steam reduces the amount of fuel oil required to generate each pound of steam, and so reduces the space and weight requirements for the boilers.

It should be noted, however, that most auxiliary machinery is designed to operate on saturated steam. Reciprocating machinery in particular requires saturated steam for the lubrication of internal moving parts of the steam end. Ship’s boilers, therefore, are designed to produce both saturated steam and superheated steam.</Text>

  <title>Boilers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p> Marine boilers provide the steam to turn the propeller, power the generators, make fresh
      water, operate steam driven pumps and blowers, heat the quarters, support the galley, and meet
      all other steam requirements of the ship. Operation of the boilers is critical to the
      operation of the vessel, and marine engineers must have a thorough understanding of boilers in
      order to operate them safely and economically. Boilers can be dangerous. Improper actions or
      inactions can lead to a boiler explosion, likely killing everyone in the engine room and
      perhaps everyone on the ship. The US Coast Guard requires all operators of marine boilers to
      be competent, and you can not operate a boiler until you have been trained, acquired the
      required sea experience, and passed the US Coast Guard license exam. Coast Guard Licensing
      requirements came about as a result of many tragic boiler explosions in the early years of
      steam propulsion, including the explosion of the <em>Sultana</em>, which killed over 1500
      Union soldiers returning home from Vicksburg, Mississippi in April 1865. </p>
    <p> There are many different types of marine boilers. Boilers on steam driven ships are
      considered <em>propulsion boilers</em>, and are designed to meet the large steam demands of
      the main engines, as well as all the other steam requirements of the vessel. Diesel and gas
      turbine powered ships are equipped with smaller <em>auxiliary boilers</em> to supply the steam
      requirements of these vessels. Propulsion boilers are normally fired with heavy fuel oil, or
      in a few cases today, coal, while the heat source for auxiliary boilers is either fuel oil,
      diesel oil, or the waste heat from the main propulsion diesel or gas turbine. Marine boilers,
      while similar to boilers found ashore, are designed to meet the particular requirements of
      shipboard use. They are designed to be light and compact to fit into small engine rooms,
      capable of operating under rapidly changing loads when the vessel is maneuvering, and to
      operate reliably while the vessel is pitching and rolling during a storm. </p>

    <p> In this chapter we will briefly discuss the construction and operation of a main propulsion
      boiler similar to the one found on many steam ships, including our own ship <em>TS
        Kennedy</em>. </p>

    <title>Boiler Construction</title>
    <introduction>
      <p> A cutaway view of a typical marine boiler is shown in <xref ref="sg-0008_png"/>. This
        boiler is described as a <em>water-tube</em>, D-Type, accelerated natural circulation
        boiler, because its tubes contain the water and steam, not combustion gases; are arranged
        roughly like the letter <em>D</em>; and because the water circulates through the boiler
        without a pump, purely due to differences in the density of the water and steam. Early
        marine boilers, and some auxiliary boilers today are designated <em>fire-tube</em> boilers,
        because the hot exhaust gases products of combustion pass through the tubes, and the water
        surrounds the tubes. Other boiler designs and auxiliary boilers will be discussed in more
        detail in later courses at MMA, either <em>Steam Generators</em> for marine engineers, or
          <em>Commercial Boilers</em> for facilities engineers. </p>
      <p> Steam is generated by burning fuel in the furnace, heating and boiling the water contained
        inside the tubes and the drums at the top and bottom of the boiler. The gases of combustion
        flow over the tubes, and since the water temperature within the tubes is lower than the gas
        temperature, heat flows from the combustion gases into the water. As the heat flows into the
        water, the water temperature starts to rise, and continues to rise until the water begins to
        boil. The boiling water forms vapor bubbles like those seen on the bottom of a pan on the
        stove. The specific volume of these vapor or steam bubbles is about 1600 times greater than
        the specific volume of the surrounding water. Since density is the inverse of specific
        volume, the steam bubbles float and rise up to the highest point, the <em>steam drum</em>.
        From there, the steam is collected and directed into the superheater tubes, where it picks
        up additional heat energy, and then is sent on to the main engine as superheated steam to
        propel the ship or serve other functions. </p>
      <p> The main components of the boiler will be described in this section. </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="steamdrum2">
      <title>Steam Drum</title>
      <p> The steam drum, <xref ref="steamdrum_png"/>, is a cylindrical steel vessel located near
        the top of the boiler. It serves two purposes: it is an upper reservoir for the water in the
        boiler, and it is the point where the steam is separated from the water. The normal
        steam/water interface is located half way up the steam drum, and visible to the operator
        through the <em>boiler gage glass</em>. It is critical that a water level be maintained in
        the steam drum at all times when the boiler is operating. Without sufficient water in the
        boiler, the heat of the furnace would melt the boiler tubes and disable the boiler. One of
        the engineer’s most critical duties is to maintain the water level in the boiler at all
        times. </p>
      <figure xml:id="steamdrum_png">
        <caption>Steam Drum Internals</caption>
        <image source="pics/boilers/steamdrum.png" width="75%"/>
      </figure>
      <p> The lower portion of the steam drum, where it is perforated by the boiler tubes is thicker
        than the upper section, for strength. The lower portion is called the <em>tube sheet</em>,
        and the upper portion is called the <em>wrapper sheet</em>. The ends of the steam drum are
        known as the <em>heads</em>, and one of the heads is fitted with a <em>manhole</em>, to
        allow access to the inside of the drum for inspection or repair. </p>
      <p> The top of the steam drum is fitted with an air cock, which is simply a pipe terminated
        with two valves. When the valves are open, the boiler steam drum pressure can equalize with
        the atmosphere. The air cock is opened when the boiler is first lit off. As the steam begins
        to form, it is allowed to blow out the air cock, expelling any air which has collected in
        the drum. After the steam pressure has built up to 20–30 psi and all air is expelled, the
        air cock is closed to seal the drum. It remains closed at all times while the boiler is
        operating, and is not opened again until the boiler is secured. After the fires are
        extinguished and as the boiler begins to cool down, the air cock must be reopened again at
        about 50 psi. Otherwise, the condensing steam in the steam drum will create a vacuum there,
        breaking the seal at the boiler hand-hole gaskets, which are primarily designed to seal
        against internal, not external, pressure. </p>
      <p> A <em>steam drum safety valve</em> is also located on top of the steam drum. This valve is
        adjusted to open automatically if the steam drum pressure rises too high. This can protect
        the boiler from exploding, and the noise of the steam flowing through should alert the
        engineer that something is seriously wrong. If you ever hear a boiler safety valve blowing
        off steam, your first action as an engineer should be to secure the fires, to prevent
        additional steam from being generated, until you know what is causing the problem. </p>
      <p> Inside the steam drum you will find several internal fittings. These fittings help
        distribute water evenly throughout the drum, separate the generated steam from the water,
        and remove moisture from the steam before it leaves the boiler. The <em>dry pipe</em> is a
        perforated tube located at the top of the steam drum. As steam is formed and rises to the
        top of the boiler, it enters the dry pipe and from there it is removed from the steam drum.
        It is important that no moisture enter the dry pipe, because water droplets in the steam
        would damage the turbines downstream, so modern boilers include <em>cyclone steam
          separators</em> which help to remove moisture from the steam by causing it to spin rapidly
        around a spiral path as it moves upward. The centrifugal force throws the heavier water
        droplets to the separator walls, where it drains back to the drum. Only dry steam should
        make it through the separator. A <em>chemical feed pipe</em> is provided to distribute
        boiler chemicals throughout the steam drum. Another perforated pipe known as the
          <em>internal feed pipe</em> is located below the water level and is used to distribute the
        incoming feedwater evenly throughout the steam drum. The <em>surface blow pipe</em> is
        another perforated pipe located below the water level and connected overboard. Opening the
          <em>surface blow valve</em> allows boiler water to discharge over the side. This is done
        to rid the boiler of contaminants such as suspended solids, oil and excess boiler chemicals,
        and in emergencies to lower the boiler water level quickly. </p>
      <p> You may also find a <em>submerged tube desuperheater</em> in the steam drum. This is a
        pipe which makes several passes underneath the surface of the water in the steam drum.
        Superheated steam is passed through this pipe, where it cools down to near its saturation
        temperature. Internal desuperheaters like this are used for two purposes. Most commonly,
        they are used to provide desuperheated steam for auxiliary systems which are not designed to
        operate on high temperature superheated steam. Other desuperheaters are used to reduce and
        control the temperature of the main superheated steam by blending the hot superheated steam
        with cooler desuperheated steam; this type is called a <em>control desuperheater.</em>
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="waterdrum">
      <title>Water drum</title>
      <p> The <em>water drum</em>, also known as the <em>mud drum</em>, is another cylindrical
        vessel, usually smaller in diameter than the steam drum and located at the bottom of the
        boiler, which acts as a lower reservoir for water. The water drum also serves as a
        collection point for the sludge that normally forms in the boiler as chemicals precipitate
        out of the boiler water as it is evaporated. These solids can be removed by a <em>bottom
          blow</em> which discharges them over the side. </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="tubesandheaders">
      <title>Tubes and headers</title>
      <p> The boiler tubes connect the steam drum to the water drum, roughly in the shape of a
        letter <q>D.</q> A boiler may contain perhaps 2000 tubes, most of which are considered
          <em>generating tubes</em>, where the majority of the steam produced by the boiler is
        formed. As the steam formed in the generating tubes rises up to the steam drum, it must be
        replaced with cooler water from the steam drum. This water is carried down through tubes
        located in cooler areas of the boiler, known as <em>downcomers</em>. A typical generating
        tube would be about 1 to 1½ inch diameter, while the downcomers are larger; 3 to 11 inches
        in diameter. </p>
      <p> The roof, rear, and side <em>waterwall tubes</em> run up the sides and ceiling in the
        furnace area to protect the furnace walls from too much heat. These tubes normally act as
        downcomers, carrying water from the steam drum down to the water drum, but at high firing
        rates may act as generating tubes. Since waterwall tubes absorb the heat of the furnace,
        less refractory material is required to insulate the boiler, which reduces the total boiler
        weight. </p>
      <p> The first few rows of tubes in the gas path are known as <em>Screen tubes</em>. Their
        location between the burner flames and the <em>superheater tubes</em> protects the
          <em>superheater</em> from the direct radiant heat of the flame. </p>
      <p>
        <em>Headers</em> are circular or square pressure vessels, used to distribute water to the
        boiler tubes. The <em>side wall</em> and <em>rear wall</em> headers are supplied with water
        from a downcomer, and distribute it to the side and rear wall tubes, and in some boiler
        designs, a <em>screen tube</em> header distributes water to the screen tubes. Sludge
        accumulates in the headers, and they must be blown down periodically like the water drum.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="superheater">
      <title>Superheater</title>
      <p> When water boils, it occurs at a particular temperature which is determined by the
        pressure of the surroundings. For example, water at atmospheric pressure always boils at 212
        °F, while water at 600 psia always boils at 486 °F. This boiling temperature is known as the
          <em>saturation temperature</em> and it can easily be determined from the steam tables
        found in . At a given pressure, the steam’s temperature can be raised above the
        corresponding saturation temperature by adding additional heat to the steam, but this must
        occur in an area where there is no liquid water present, or the additional heat would simply
        boil more water and would not raise the steam temperature at all. Raising steam temperature
        above the saturation temperature is known as <em>superheating</em> and the <em>degree of
          superheat</em> refers to the difference between the steam temperature and the saturation
        temperature corresponding to the steam’s pressure. For example, 600 psia, 600 °F steam would
        have 114 degrees of superheat, since it is 114 degrees above the corresponding saturation
        temperature. </p>
      <p> In marine boilers, superheating occurs in the <em>superheater</em>. The superheater is a
        series of boiler tubes located in the hottest part of the gas path, but screened from the
        radiant heat of the furnace behind three or more rows of <em>screen tubes</em>. Heat is
        added to the superheater primarily by convection. The superheater tubes and headers may be
        installed either horizontally or vertically. </p>
      <p> All the steam formed in the generating tubes rises up to the steam drum and flows into the
        dry pipe, and from there the steam, which is dry and at saturation temperature, enters the
        superheater header and is distributed to the superheater tubes. There, the steam picks up
        sensible heat, which increases the energy content of the steam, improving the overall steam
        cycle efficiency and reducing fuel consumption. The steam leaves the boiler at the
        superheater outlet. At the outlet you will find a <em>superheater vent</em> and a
          <em>superheater safety valve</em> followed by the main and turbogenerator steam stop
        valves. </p>
      <p> The degree of superheat created in the superheater is determined by several factors,
        including the temperature of the feedwater, the load on the boiler, and the number and
        location of burners in use. These factors are not adjustable by the engineer, so the
        superheater outlet temperature is not under his direct control. A boiler of this type is
        known as an<em>uncontrolled superheat</em> boiler. Other boiler designs provide a means to
        control the superheat temperature independent of the above factors, and are known as
          <em>controlled superheat</em> boilers. </p>
      <p> The superheater elements are normally filled entirely with steam, not water. Since no
        boiling occurs there, all the heat transferred to the superheater tubes must be carried away
        by the steam flowing through the tubes, or else they will quickly overheat and burn out,
        destroying the boiler. Whenever there is a fire in the boiler and no steam flow leaving the
        boiler, the superheater vent must be opened manually by the engineer to protect the
        superheater from overheating. </p>

    <subsection xml:id="safetyvalves">
      <title>Safety Valves</title>
      <figure xml:id="safetyvalve_png">
        <caption>Safety Valve</caption>
        <image source="pics/boilers/safetyvalve.png" width="75%"/>
      </figure>
      <p> The boiler is equipped with three safety valves, similar to the one shown in <xref
          ref="register_png"/> Two are located on the steam drum, and one on the superheater outlet
        pipe. The safety valve outlets are connected to the <em>sky pipe</em> which discharges
        outside the engine room up the smokestack. The safety valves are set to open if the boiler
        pressure becomes too high. The superheater safety valve is adjusted to the lowest opening
        pressure, so it will open first, followed by the two drum safeties. It is important that the
        superheater safety valve opens first, because if the drum safety valve opened first, there
        would be a disruption of the flow of steam through the superheater, which would cause it to
        overheat. </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="burners">
      <title>Burners</title>
      <p> Several fuel oil burners are located on the front of the boiler to deliver fuel and air to
        the boiler furnace in the proper mixture to obtain optimum combustion. The burner assembly,
          <xref ref="register_png"/>, consists of two main parts, the <em>fuel oil atomizer</em>
        assembly, which breaks up the fuel oil into a fine mist and sprays it into the furnace, and
        the <em>air register</em> assembly, which directs the air flow into the furnace to insure
        good air/fuel mixture for complete combustion. The burner may also include a peephole or a
        flame scanner to monitor the status of the flame, a torch hole for lighting the flame,
        and/or an igniter so that the burner can be lit off automatically as required by the
        combustion control system. </p>
      <figure xml:id="register_png">

      <figure xml:id="atomizer_png">
        <caption>Atomizer</caption>
        <image source="pics/boilers/atomizer.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p> A cross sectional view of a <em>steam atomizer</em> is shown in <xref ref="atomizer_png"
        />. In this design, steam under pressure is used to force fuel through the <em>sprayer
          plate</em> and <em>orifice</em> and into the furnace as small droplets with high velocity
        which ignite easily and mix thoroughly with the surrounding air. The fuel forms a
        cone-shaped spray of oil which extends far into the furnace. Steam atomizers are capable of
        providing good atomization at all steaming rates, however the steam used for atomization is
        lost from the steam cycle and must be replaced with make-up feed. </p>
      <p> When steam is not available for atomization, such as when lighting off a dead ship, a
        steam assist atomizer can not be used. Under these circumstances, a <em>straight
          mechanical</em> atomizer is used instead. In this design, fuel pressure alone atomizes the
        fuel into tiny particles. The quality of the atomization depends on the fuel pressure, so
        this design is not particularly suitable for use when the boiler load and fuel pressure are
        varying frequently, as it requires the operator to frequently change sprayer plates to
        compensate for varying fuel pressures. </p>
      <p> The register assembly consists of three main parts. The <em>movable air doors</em> allow
        the operator to open and close the register. The doors are opened wide when the register is
        in service, and closed when it is not being used. The <em>diffuser plate</em> helps the air
        to mix evenly with the oil and it prevents the flame from being blown back behind the
        atomizer. The <em>stationary air foils</em> guide the majority of the air, giving it a
        swirling motion and directing it toward the oil cone beyond the diffuser. </p>
      <p> The air and gas flow paths through the boiler are shown in <xref ref="boilergasflow_png"
        />. Air supplied by the forced draft fan passes across the tubes of a steam heated air
        heater, and then through the boiler casing where it picks up more heat. The air passes
        through the register and into the furnace, where it meets up with fuel sprayed by the
        atomizer. It immediately ignites, and the burner flame liberates heat energy from the fuel
        to heat the water in the boiler. Some of this heat is in the form of thermal radiation which
        shines on the exposed screen and wall tubes. Other energy resides in the thermal energy of
        the combustion gases. These hot combustion gases flow from the furnace through the screen
        tubes, past the superheater tubes and the main generating bank and finally across the
        economizer tubes, losing heat and dropping in temperature along the way. Finally, the hot
        combustion gases pass up the smokestack to the atmosphere. </p>

    <subsection xml:id="boilercasing">
      <title>Boiler Casing</title>
      <p> The entire boiler is surrounded by a two-layered casing which provides an airtight
        enclosure for the boiler, see <xref ref="refractory_png"/>. Air from the forced draft
        blowers flows between the two casings. Both the inner and outer casings of the boiler are
        made of steel panels. The panels are removable to provide access to the boiler tubes for
        inspection or repair, and are welded or bolted together with gaskets to form an airtight

        boiler is prevented by enclosing the furnace with a thermal insulating material known as

        work together to insulate the boiler. From inside to outside, the layers of refractory are: </p>

      <title>Economizer</title>
      <p> The economizer is a finned tube heat exchanger located in the gas path beyond the tube
        bank at the base of the exhaust stack. Combustion gases flow across the economizer tubes
        while feedwater flows through the tubes. The gases give up some of their remaining energy to
        heat the incoming feedwater before passing out the stack. </p>

      <title>Boiler Circulation</title>
      <p> It is important to understand the flow paths of water, steam, air and combustion gases
        through the boiler. This circulation is illustrated in <xref ref="boilersteamflow_png"/>. </p>

      <p> The process begins when feedwater is discharged from the feed pump, passes through the
        feedwater control valve, enters the economizer inlet header and flows through the economizer
        tubes to the outlet. The feedwater picks up about 100 to 200° of sensible heat in the
        economizer and exits at about 350 °F. </p>
      <p> The Feedwater leaves the economizer and enters the steam drum via the internal feed pipe.
        The feed pipe distributes the water evenly along the length of the steam drum. The coolest
        and densest water flows down through the downcomers, and perhaps some of the waterwall
        tubes, screen tubes and generating tubes, to the water drum and lower headers. From there
        the water is distributed to the various tubes and replaces the water which has turned to
        steam. </p>
      <p> The water in the generating tubes is exposed to the combustion gases through heat transfer
        across the tube walls. This increases the water temperature and decreases its density,
        causing it to rise upward. The water temperature increases until it reaches the saturation
        temperature of 486 °F, at which point steam bubbles begin to form. These bubbles are
        saturated steam, and they rise up and enter the steam drum, carrying liquid water along with
        them. </p>
      <p> In the steam drum, the water-steam mixture enters the cyclone separators which removes the
        excess water from the steam by centrifugal action. Separated water falls back to the steam
        drum above the baffle plates, while the steam enters the dry pipe. From there the steam
        flows out of the steam drum and into the superheater header. </p>
      <p> From the superheater header, the steam is directed into the superheater tubes, where it
        makes several passes through the furnace, increasing the steam temperature to approximately
        850 °F, and then it exits through the outlet header. </p>
      <p> Superheated steam leaves the outlet header and flows to the one of three places: the main
        engine, the turbogenerators, or back into the boiler. The portion returning to the boiler
        enters the desuperheater, which is a pipe submerged below the water level in the steam drum.
        There the steam cools back down to near its saturation temperature, flows out through the
        auxiliary steam stop valve, and on to all the remaining steam consumers on the ship. </p>
      <p> At the same time this is occurring, air from the engine room is being drawn in by the
        forced draft fans, blown across the tubes of the steam air heater and down through the space
        between the inner and outer casing. This air then passes through the register air doors and
        into the furnace. Here it meets with the finely atomized fuel droplets, which quickly heat
        up to their ignition temperature and burn. </p>
      <p> The resulting combustion gases, under a slight pressure due to the forced draft fans, pass
        across the boiler tubes; first the screen tubes, then the superheater tubes, the generating
        tubes, and finally the economizer tubes, before leaving the boiler up the stack. </p>

    <title>Monitoring the Boiler</title>
    <introduction>
      <p> Watchstanders must continuously monitor the boiler while it is in operation to prevent
        small problems from becoming big problems. Most of the time, the boiler automation system
        works correctly and the boiler seems to take care of itself, but it only takes a small
        problem and a few minutes of inattention before you have a serious casualty: the boiler can
        overheat and melt, over-pressurize and lift safety valves, or even explode! During a boiler
        casualty, time is critical; the sooner a problem is detected, the easier it is to take care
        of. Ideally, the engineer should notice the symptoms developing and respond, long before it
        gets serious – even before an alarm rings. Of course, the licensed watch engineer has the
        primary responsibility for the safe operation of the boiler, but even a youngie can become a
        hero by noticing something wrong, and bringing it to his attention in time to save the
        plant! </p>
      <p> In this section, we will discuss the boiler parameters that you should watch whenever
        you’re in the engine room, and especially whenever you’re on watch in the control room or
        the fire room. </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="waterlevel">
      <title>Water level</title>
      <p> Maintaining proper boiler water level in the steam drum is probably the most critical
        aspect of boiler operation. <em>High Water</em> is harmful because it reduces the efficiency
        of the steam separators. More importantly, excessively high water will enter the dry pipe,
        pass through the superheater and enter the turbine – a condition known as
        <em>carryover</em>. Carryover leads to dangerous <em>water hammer</em> in the steam lines,
        scaling in the superheater, and will damage to turbine rotors and thrust bearings. <em>Low
          Water</em> is perhaps even more harmful than high water. It the boiler water level falls
        too low, portions of the generating tubes will be uncovered and the furnace temperature will
        quickly overheat and weaken the boiler tubes, leading to catastrophic boiler damage, steam
        escape, and personnel injury. </p>
      <p> The boiler is equipped with several means to observe the boiler water level. The simplest
        is the <em>boiler gage glass</em>. This device is mounted on the steam drum and makes the
        water level in the drum directly visible in the same way that the glass on the side of a
        coffee urn works. The glass is mounted such that the normal operating level is in the center
        of the glass, and as long as the water level is visible in the glass, the boiler is safe,
        however the operator should never let the level get within two inches of the top or bottom
        of the gage glass. A visible water level in the gage glass is reassuring, but it may be a
        false level if the gage glass valves are closed or the lines are blocked. Periodically
        blowing down the gage glass will insure that it indicates accurately. The <em>remote level
          indicator</em>, <xref ref="waterlevel_png"/>, is a water level sensor connected to a level
        display that can be mounted in any location, normally wherever convenient for the boiler
        operator. This device is also called the <em>eye-hi</em> indicator. <em>High and Low Level
          Alarms</em> are sensors which are used to trigger an alarm when the water reaches a
        critical level. Usually two sensors are provided, the first gives a warning signal when the
        level is about six inches above or below the normal water level, the second secures the
        fires if the level continues to rise or fall after the warning alarm. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <term>Important:</term>
        </p>
        <p> The boiler water level must be visible in the gage glass at all times. Any time the
          water level is not visible, either high or low, the boiler fires must be secured
            <em>immediately</em>. </p>

      </figure>
      <p> The feed water regulator system is designed to monitor and maintain the water level in the
        boiler automatically under all normal loads and operating conditions. The main feed pump
        takes a suction from the DC Heater, and discharges through the feedwater regulating valve,
        then into the economizer and the steam drum. The feedwater regulator contains a <em>drum
          level sensor</em> which opens or closes the regulating valve in response to the drum water
        level. When the water level goes up, the regulating valve closes off to restrict the feed
        water to the drum and bring the level down, and vice versa. This drum level sensing
        regulator uses <em>feedback control</em>, which means that is has a fairly slow response;
        the drum level must deviate from normal before the regulator can make a correction. To
        improve the regulator response, most feedwater regulator systems also include a steam flow
        sensor, which gives the regulator a predictive ability known as <em>feedforward
        control</em>. As soon as the sensor detects a change in the steam flow, it can respond
        immediately with a corresponding change in the feedwater flow rate. Feedwater regulators
        containing both drum level and steam flow sensors are known as <em>two-element</em>
        feedwater regulators. </p>
      <p> The feed water regulator system uses compressed air from the <em>combustion control air
          system</em> to actuate the feed water regulator valve and power the regulator. The watch
        engineer must carefully watch the control air system pressure, because problems there will
        quickly lead to problems with the boiler water level. If the control air compressor fails,
        one response would be to cross connect the <em>ship’s service air</em> into the system.
        Complete loss of compressed air will cause the feedwater regulator valve to open wide. The
        operator then must adjust the feed water check valve manually to regulate the boiler drum
        level. </p>
      <p> The discharge pressure of the feed pump plays a critical role in the proper operation of
        the feedwater regulator system. Naturally, the feed pump discharge pressure must be greater
        than the steam drum pressure at all times, or the feed water will not be able to flow into
        the boiler. Also, if the feed pump discharge pressure fluctuates, the regulator system will
        have a difficult time responding properly, so the feed pump is equipped with a <em>constant
          pressure governor</em> which maintains a steady discharge pressure at all times, or an
          <em>excess pressure governor</em>, which maintains a fixed pressure differential above the
        drum pressure. The watch engineer should keep a close eye on the feed pump discharge
        pressure, because changes here will quickly lead to problems with the steam drum level. A
        stand-by feed pump should always be maintained ready to start quickly if the operating pump
        has problems. </p>
      <p> When operating, the boiler water level is subject to <em>shrink and swell</em>. The
        specific volume of steam is dependent on the pressure of the surroundings; lower pressure
        steam takes up more space. When the main engine throttles are opened, the boiler pressure
        temporarily drops as the steam rushes to the turbine. This drop in pressure causes the steam
        bubbles remaining in the generating tubes to expand, forcing the water level in the drum to
        rise or <em>swell</em>. When the throttles are closed the reverse happens; the boiler
        pressure increases quickly, and compresses the steam bubbles, causing the water level to
          <em>shrink</em>. A properly adjusted two-element feed water regulator will respond
        properly to shrink and swell. For example, during swell conditions the drum level sensor
        sees high water and asks the regulating valve to close off, while at the same time, the
        steam flow sensor detects an increase in steam flow, and asks the regulating valve to open
        more. The two effects cancel each other out, and the regulating valve holds its position,
        which is the correct response, since the actual mass of water in the boiler really hasn’t
        changed. Later as the drum pressure recovers, the swell subsides and the steam flow signal
        remains, causing the regulator to open a bit more. Close observation of the feed water
        regulator during maneuvering will be valuable if you are ever called upon to regulate the
        boiler water level manually. </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="steampressureandtemperature">
      <title>Steam Pressure and Temperature</title>
      <p> Steam pressure and temperature are important parameters to watch while the boiler is
        operating. Obviously, the purpose of the boiler is to produce steam at the correct pressure
        and temperature to be used by the main engine and auxiliary machinery. Under normal
        conditions these values are maintained by the combustion control system and should be
        relatively steady. A rising or falling steam value is a sure indication of an impending
        problem. You should carefully observe the normal operating range for the drum and
        superheater outlet pressures, and notify the engineer or take corrective action if these
        values deviate from normal. </p>
      <p> High steam pressure, if left unchecked will lead to the superheater safety valves lifting.
        Properly designed and maintained safety valves are capable of relieving the entire boiler to
        prevent a boiler explosion, but they should never have to open on a properly operated
        boiler. Low steam pressure will cause a loss of power at the main engines and generators.
        Failure to respond will lead to electrical blackout of the ship and loss of propulsion
        power. Incorrect superheat temperature is less harmful than incorrect steam pressure, but
        you should still note it and correct it if possible. High and low superheat temperatures
        often indicates another problem with the boiler such as dirty burners, excess air, or
        incorrect feed temperatures. On ships with controlled superheat, the superheater temperature
        control system may be faulty. </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="smoke">
      <title>Smoke</title>
      <p> Fuel burns by chemically reacting with the oxygen in the air provided by the forced draft
        fans. An incorrect mixture of fuel and air will cause the boiler to produce smoke, which
        must be avoided to comply with environmental laws and maximize boiler efficiency. </p>
      <p> Since the chemical reaction of the combustion process is understood, and we know that air
        contains about 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen, we can calculate precisely how many pounds of
        air are required to burn each pound of fuel completely. If the combustion control system
        admitted exactly this much air however, the combustion would still be incomplete, because we
        can’t insure perfect mixing of all the air with the fuel. Some of the available oxygen would
        never reach the unburned fuel droplets. To avoid this problem, a properly operated boiler
        always provides some <em>excess air</em> beyond the amount theoretically required, to insure
        complete combustion. Too much excess air will cause unnecessary heat loss up the smokestack,
        reducing the boiler’s efficiency. </p>
      <p> One way to monitor the amount of excess air is to watch the color of the smoke produced by
        the boiler. A properly operated boiler will have a colorless or light exhaust; black smoke
        indicates insufficient combustion air for the amount of fuel, and white smoke indicates the
        opposite. The boiler is equipped with a periscope smoke indicator which allows the operator
        to look through the stack to observe the color of the exhaust gases. The periscope should be
        checked frequently, and the fuel/air ratio adjusted as necessary to maintain a clear stack
        with a minimum of excess air. Be aware that a clear stack may still have too much air; try
        reducing the air until a light haze develops, then increase slightly. Be alert also that
        heavy white smoke appears black in the periscope because it completely blocks the light. </p>
      <p> Watching the color of the smoke is a fairly crude method to maintain proper oxygen trim. A
        more precise method is to use an oxygen monitoring system to detect the level of O2 in the
        stack gases and use it to adjust the excess air with a feedback control loop. </p>

    <title>Operating the Boiler</title>
    <subsection xml:id="lightingoff">
      <title>Lighting Off</title>
      <p> The process of igniting the flame in the boiler is called <em>lighting off</em>. This is a
        critical operation because following incorrect procedures can lead to a furnace explosion. A
        boiler is lit off manually with a flaming torch, or with an automatic igniter. </p>
      <p> To prevent a boiler explosion, there must be no unburned fuel or fuel vapors in the
        furnace when the torch is inserted. We insure this by properly <em>purging</em> the furnace
        prior to lighting off. To purge, open all register air doors and run the forced draft fans
        on High Speed for at least five minutes. Only after a good purge is it safe to insert the
        torch, turn on the fuel supply, and light off the burner. Once one burner is lit off,
        adjoining burners can easily be lit from the flame of the first. Automated systems follow
        the same procedure automatically, but use an igniter instead of a torch. </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="superheatervent">
      <title>Superheater Vent</title>
      <p> Whenever there is a flame in the boiler, there must be steam flow through the superheater.
        Without this steam flow, the superheater tubes will overheat and burn out. Insuring steam
        flow through the superheater is not a problem when the boiler is operating on the line,
        since the normal flow to the turbine and auxiliaries provides sufficient flow, but it is
        significant during the boiler warm up period and during boiler casualties. At these times,
        it is critical to open the <em>superheater vent valve</em> located on the superheater
        outlet. Opening this valve permits a small amount of steam to flow up the smokestack and
        provide sufficient cooling to protect the superheater. </p>

      <title>Cleaning Burners</title>
      <p> As the boiler is operated, the burner tips tend to get clogged with deposits of unburned
        fuel oil. Once each day the burners must be removed from the boiler and cleaned. The burner
        is removed and allowed to cool, then the tip is removed and soaked in a burner cleaning
        solution to loosen up the deposits. After soaking, the remaining deposits are removed by
        scraping with a brass or copper implement. Soft metal tools are used to avoid damaging the
        tip and holes. Finally the burner is reassembled, inspected and placed back into service. Be
        aware that the burner cleaning solution, called <em>carbon remover</em>, will cause chemical
        burns of your skin and eyes. Always use caution, and wear proper protective gear such as
        rubber gloves and a face shield, when working with carbon remover. </p>

    <subsection xml:id="blowingtubes">
      <title>Blowing Tubes</title>
      <p> Combustion gases leave ash or soot deposits on the tube surfaces which reduce heat
        transfer to the boiler water. Soot blowers are used to remove this soot from the tube
        surfaces, either using steam or high pressure compressed air to blow the soot off of the
        tube surfaces. Tubes are normally blown once or twice a day when at sea, before and after
        leaving port, and after boiler casualties which cause heavy smoke. </p>

        <caption>Sootblower</caption>
        <image source="pics/boilers/sootblower.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p> A steam powered rotary soot blower is shown in <xref ref="sootblower_png"/>. The element,
        a long pipe with several spray holes, is turned manually with a chain or automatically by an
        air powered motor. Rotating the element also turns a cam which opens the steam valve when
        the nozzles are pointing in the desired direction. In the design shown, the sootblower
        element always remains in the furnace, and must be continuously cooled or it will overheat.
        This is accomplished by circulating a small amount of <em>scavenging air</em> through the
        element when it is not in service. The source of the scavenging air is the pressurized
        combustion air in the boiler double casing. A check valve installed in the scavenging line
        prevents steam from entering the air casing during soot blower operation. In other
        sootblower designs, the element can be completely retracted from the furnace and is only
        inserted during the soot blowing operation. </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="boilerwatertreatment">
      <title>Boiler Water Treatment</title>
      <p> Boiler water must be treated chemically to avoid problems such as Scale, Corrosion, Sludge
        Formation, and Foaming. Scale is caused by impurities such as calcium and magnesium
        precipitating out of the water, and by suspended solids settling out and adhering to the
        tube surfaces. Scale deposits on the tubes act as thermal insulation which reduces the heat
        transfer across the tubes and increases the tube temperatures. Corrosion due to dissolved
        oxygen attacks the iron of the tubes and leads to its deterioration. Untreated sludge will
        bake onto the heat transfer surfaces and cause overheating, and suspended solids will cause
        a foam to form in the steam drum leading to carryover. </p>
      <p> The boiler water must be tested and boiler chemicals added each day to maintain correct pH
        levels to limit corrosion, and for correct phosphate levels, which help to precipitate out
        calcium and magnesium. Periodic surface blowdowns are conducted on a steaming boiler to
        remove suspended solids, lower the conductivity, and remove dissolved substances contained
        in the water. Sludge accumulations in the mud drum and headers are removed by conducting
        bottom blows. A boiler can only receive a bottom blow when it is secured, since blowing a
        steaming boiler could interrupt the natural circulation flow and cause tube overheating.

\f1\fs28 A steam strainer is located in the steam line upstream of the main engine to prevent   objects other than steam from entering the turbines, since solid objects impacting the   turbine blades would quickly destroy them. Steam lines would normally be expected to be   quite clean, but a strainer is cheap insurance against nuts, tools, and gloves left in the   lines by shipyard workers, or rust flakes formed during a layup period. Unfortunately, water   droplets due to wet steam or carryover will pass through the steam strainer.\

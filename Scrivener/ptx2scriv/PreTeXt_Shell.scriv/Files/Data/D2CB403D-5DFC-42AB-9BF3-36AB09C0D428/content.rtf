\f1\fs28 An electric motor has a role opposite to that of a generator, in that a motor draws   electric power and converts it to mechanical power. Most shipboard motors are AC, because   they are smaller and less costly than DC motors of similar power output. DC motors are used   only rarely on modern ships. <term>Universal motors</term> operate on either AC or DC.\

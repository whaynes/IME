<p class="folderTitle">Fundamentals of electricity</p>
<p class="itemText">Electricity is associated with the accumulation or the flow of electrons, which are negatively-charged, subatomic particles. Static electricity is caused by the accumulation of electrons, as might occur from rubbing hard rubber on a wool carpet. The resulting static charge of the stored electrons might then be released suddenly as a spark. In a more useful form of electricity, the electrons flow through wires to energize light bulbs and computers and to turn the shafts of motors.</span></p></p>

<p class="itemText">Fuel cells are similar to·batteries but supply power continuously because the electrolyte <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is continuously rejuvenated. This rejuvenation is achieved by continuously adding hydrogen <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and oxygen to the electrolyte. Fuel cells operating on pure hydrogen have been used in space <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>vehicles for years, but advancing technology will allow fuel cell systems to operate on less <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>expensive, readily available hydrocarbon fuels from which the hydrogen can be separated. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuel-cell systems have the potenti...</p>

<p class="folderTitle">Shipboard electric systems</p>
<p class="itemText">Most American ships use 60 Hz AC supplied at 480 volts. For large shipboard electric plants, where the ship's generating capacity is above 2500 kW, it is often more economical to supply the power at 2400 or 4160 volts. 50 Hz is common on foreign ships. Some naval vessels use 400 Hz for special applications.</span></p></p>

<p class="folderTitle">Electric propulsion</p>
<p class="itemText">Electric drives for ship propulsion have been used for over 100 years, employing generators driven by steam turbines, diesel engines, or gas turbines to power the &lt;term&gt;propulsion <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>motor&lt;/term&gt;(s) on the propeller shaft(s). ln comparison to geared drive, electric drive is more expensive to install, heavier, and less efficient. Electric drive is therefore normally used only where these disadvantages are outweighed by the advantages, which include excellent control of propeller speed and directio...</p>

            <p> There are two main methods used for propulsion of merchant ships today: steam turbines and
      diesel engines. Sail and steam reciprocating engines are long obsolete, and nuclear power,
      while used for some naval vessels, has been found to be impractical for merchant ships.
      Recently a few ships have been built with gas turbine propulsion, but it is not yet common. </p>
         </item>
         <item>
            <p> Over the last 40 years, diesel propulsion has displaced steam propulsion as the dominant
      method of merchant ship propulsion, mainly because it has higher fuel efficiency, but also
      because it is easier to automate, requires less maintenance, and can be operated with smaller
      crews – all factors leading to operating cost reductions. Nevertheless, steam propulsion
      remains important, if for no other reason than it is the method we use aboard our training
      ship <em>Kennedy</em>. Also, steam power is used extensively in industry and power generation
      ashore, and the skills developed by a steam engineer aboard ship find high demand in the
      shoreside job market. </p>
         </item>
         <item>
            <p> In this chapter we will discuss steam propulsion and the steam cycle. The steam cycle is the
      thermodynamic process which marine engineers use to transform the energy contained in the
      ship’s fuel oil or <em>bunkers</em> into the power to turn the ship’s propeller and supply all
      the other requirements necessary to move a steam ship from one point to another. We will begin
      with a discussion of a very simplified version of the steam cycle, which nevertheless
      illustrates all the important principles of its operation. Later, we will progress to a more
      detailed, practical, and efficient version of the cycle, which more closely represents the
      cycle used on other steam ships. The function of each of the components of the cycle will be
      briefly described here, and in more detail in later chapters. This cycle described here is not
      the only possibility, but it is representative, and it provides a good foundation for further
      study. </p>

               <p> The steam cycle is an example of what is known by engineers as a <em>cyclic heat
          engine</em>. It is called cyclic, because it operates on a cycle. It uses a <em>working
          fluid</em>, water, which travels from point to point through the cycle, changing form and
        carrying energy, but eventually returning to the starting point restored to the same
          <em>state</em> that it started with. It is called a heat engine, because it transforms
          <em>heat</em>, which is a form of energy, into <em>work</em>, another form of energy. The
        thermodynamic name for this cycle is the <em>Rankine Cycle.</em>

            <item>
               <p> Steam generation occurs in the boiler. The boiler is simply a device used to boil water.
        Like a tea-kettle on the stove, it contains liquid water and a heat source. As the water is
        heated, its temperature rises and soon it begins to boil. On the stove, the water vapor or
        steam rises and dissipates into the kitchen, but not so in a boiler. The boiler is a closed
        vessel, like a pot with a lid, and any steam generated in the boiler rises to the top and is
        collected before being sent on to the next step of the cycle. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> In the generation stage, the chemical energy stored in the ship’s fuel is released when
        the fuel is burned in the boiler furnace, and some of this energy is transferred to the
        working fluid – the water. The water gains energy, and we can detect this in two ways: the
        water’s temperature goes up, and the water changes <em>state</em> from a liquid into water
        vapor, which we call steam. Steam leaves the boiler at high pressure and high temperature. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>As we will learn in <xref ref="thermodynamics"/>, heat energy which raises the temperature
        of a substance such as water or steam is sometimes called <em>sensible heat</em> while the
        heat energy that actually boils the substance is called <em>latent heat</em>. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> You probably remember that water boils at 212 °F at standard atmospheric pressure (14.7
        psia). If you put a thermometer into a pan of water boiling on the stove, this is what it
        will read. Even if you turn the flame up to add more heat energy, you won’t be able to make
        the water temperature rise above 212 °F. This is because you are adding latent heat, which
        is not reflected by an increase in the water’s temperature. All of the heat energy is being
        used to turn the liquid water into a vapor. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> The boiling or condensing temperature of a liquid is known as its <em>saturation</em>
        temperature. The saturation temperature for a particular liquid is determined by its
        pressure, and cannot be changed. For example, 212 °F is the saturation temperature for water
        at atmospheric pressure, and there is nothing anybody can do to change it. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> In order to reach high steam temperatures, which is necessary for high steam cycle
        efficiency, the boiler must be operated at a pressure far above atmospheric pressure. A
        typical marine boiler operates at about 600 psi while some have operated as high as 1200
        psi, although this introduces additional maintenance difficulties. Shoreside steam power
        plants operate at 3000 psi or even higher. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> Steam temperature is raised even further by superheating the steam. Superheating steam
        raises its temperature above the saturation temperature for the corresponding steam pressure
        by continuing to add heat to the steam after it has completely vaporized. This must take
        place in a separate area, called the <em>superheater,</em> away from liquid water, or the
        additional heat would simply boil more water rather than superheating the steam. Superheated
        steam is said to be <em>dry</em>, which means that all liquid water has vaporized and it
        contains no moisture droplets. Drops of liquid water would damage the turbine in the
        expansion step described below. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> Improving efficiency is a major concern of mechanical and marine engineers. High
        efficiency means that fuel is not wasted, and operating costs are minimized. Practical
        boiler designs incorporate many techniques to maximize efficiency. For example, not all of
        the chemical energy originally contained by the fuel ends up transferred to the steam. A
        large portion of this energy is lost up the smokestack, carried away by the combustion
        gases. Practical boilers usually contain some sort of heat exchanger in the smokestack in an
        effort to recover some of this energy. </p>

            <item>
               <p> The thermal energy added to the working fluid in the generation stage is converted to
        mechanical energy, or work, in the expansion stage. This work is produced in the form of a
        rotating turbine shaft which drives the propeller and moves the ship through the water. The
        more energy we can remove at this stage, the higher the efficiency of the steam cycle.
        Unfortunately, it is not possible to remove all the energy from the steam in the turbine.
        Some energy remains in the steam and is carried to the next stage of the cycle. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> A <em>turbine</em> is the device used to accomplish the energy transformation in the
        expansion stage. Like a pinwheel or a fan, a turbine has a freely rotating shaft with many
        carefully designed <em>turbine blades</em> attached. However, unlike a fan, the turbine
        rotor is completely enclosed in a casing which also contains <em>nozzles</em> and
          <em>stationary blades</em> designed to direct the steam towards the rotating blades. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> High-pressure, high-temperature steam passes through the nozzle, which has a very small
        opening, and it emerges with a high velocity. The thermal energy of the steam is converted
        into mechanical kinetic energy in the nozzle. This high velocity steam jet hits the blades
        and imparts a turning torque to the rotor shaft and converts its kinetic energy to
        rotational kinetic energy of the shaft. Most turbines have several rows of blades, forming
        multiple stages to extract the maximum energy from the steam. As the steam gives up its
        thermal energy, its temperature and pressure both drop. The steam leaves the turbine at a
        low temperature and low pressure. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> High steam pressure at the inlet to the turbine is important for energy conversion, but it
        is equally important to have a low pressure at the turbine outlet. Steam, or any fluid for
        that matter, will only flow from high pressure to lower pressure. Without a pressure drop
        across the blades of the turbine, there would be no steam flow, and no energy conversion. To
        maximize the energy conversion, we must also maximize the pressure drop across the turbine.

            <Title>Condensation</Title>
            <item>
               <p> As stated previously, a large pressure drop across the turbine is required to get maximum
        energy extraction from the steam. The boiler supplies the high pressure at the inlet to the
        turbine, it is the job of the condenser to create a low pressure condition at the turbine
        outlet. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> The condenser is a shell-and-tube heat exchanger cooled by seawater. It consists of a
        large, rectangular or cylindrical sealed shell containing thousands of tubes. A circulating
        pump forces cold seawater in at one end, through the tubes, and it exits overboard at the
        other end. Steam exiting from the turbine enters the condenser at the top, condenses on the
        tube surfaces and drains out the bottom. That is, the steam gives up its latent heat of
        condensation to the seawater, and returns to the liquid water state. Once the steam passes
        across the condenser tubes, it is no longer steam. It has condensed to liquid water, and
        from this point in the cycle is referred to as <em>condensate</em>. Condensate leaves the
        condenser as a low temperature, low pressure liquid. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> Because the condensation is occurring at approximately the temperature of the seawater,
        the pressure in the condenser will be approximately equal to the saturation pressure of
        steam at this temperature, assuming that no air or other gases are present. For example, if
        the seawater temperature is 80 °F, the corresponding saturation pressure would be 0.5073
        psia. This is a very high vacuum, and the greater the vacuum, the better the plant
        efficiency. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> The latent heat removed from the steam by the seawater raises the temperature and
        increases the energy contained by the seawater, and this cooling water is discharged
        overboard. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> It is unfortunate that some of the energy once contained by the fuel, and then passed on
        to the steam in the boiler, is eventually thrown away with the seawater. Wouldn’t it be
        better to somehow use this energy to power the ship? Absolutely, but there is nothing we can
        do about it! The only way to extract more energy from the steam is by having the turbine
        discharge to an even lower absolute pressure than we do. The only way to do that is to
        condense the steam at even lower temperatures than we are. But we can’t do that, because
        aboard ship there’s nothing colder than the surrounding ocean available to reject the heat
        to. If we decided not to reject any heat to the ocean at all, the pressure in the condenser
        would build up to the point where it would equal the steam pressure entering the turbine,
        and without a pressure drop, the steam would stop flowing altogether. There’s no win, but
        we’re doing the best we can. </p>

            <item>
               <p> The only thing that remains to complete the cycle is to return the condensate to the
        boiler to be heated up again. Unfortunately, the condensate leaving the condenser is at a
        low pressure and the boiler operates at a much higher pressure. Condensate won’t flow back
        into the boiler by itself. A pump is required to raise the pressure and return the
        condensate to the boiler. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> The pump, known as the <em>feed pump</em>, draws condensate from the condenser discharge,
        raises its pressure slightly above the boiler pressure, and discharges it back into the
        boiler to restart the cycle. Condensate leaving the feed pump is known as
        <em>feedwater</em>. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> Work is required to drive the feed pump, and this energy reduces the net work produced by
        the cycle and available to turn the shaft. Fortunately, since water is incompressible it
        takes much less work to raise its pressure back to the boiler pressure than we get from an
        equivalent pressure drop across the turbine, and so there is a net positive amount of work
        produced by the cycle. </p>

        flames raise the temperature of the water in the boiler and eventually cause it to boil. Not
        all energy of the fuel is transferred to the water, some remains in the combustion gases and

        surrounding liquid water, they float up to the top of the boiler and eventually rise above
        the surface of the water in the steam drum. If the steam was allowed to build up in the
        drum, the boiler pressure would quickly rise, and if not relieved by the safety valves,
        would cause the boiler to explode. The system is designed to remove steam as quickly as it
        is created, so a properly operated boiler will maintain a constant pressure. </p>

        water droplets in the steam would cause damage to the blades and thrust bearings in the

        steam will be directed to the astern section of the low pressure turbine. Blades in this

               <p> The L.P. turbine follows the H.P. turbine and continues to extract energy from the steam.
        The steam enters at a low pressure (a vacuum actually, at low loads) and exits at an even
        lower pressure into the main condenser. The specific volume of steam at these low pressures
        is large, which means that the turbine blades and the L.P. turbine itself are also large.
        When looking at the two turbines, it is always easy to identify the L.P. turbine because of

               <p> Steam leaves the L.P. turbine as saturated steam, so you can determine the steam
        temperature by looking up the saturation temperature for the condenser pressure in the steam
        tables. For example, if the condenser pressure is 28.9 in Hg vacuum, this corresponds to an
        absolute pressure of 0.5 psia, and this has a saturation temperature of about 80 °F. Are you

               <p> As stated before, the main condenser is a shell and tube heat exchanger which provides the
        low pressure zone for the turbine to discharge into. The steam entering the condenser turns
        back to liquid water when it comes in contact with the cold condenser tubes. The newly
        formed condensate drains down to the bottom of the condenser, where it collects in the
          <em>hot well</em> until it is pumped out. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> In order to maintain high plant efficiency it is necessary to maintain a good vacuum in
        the main condenser. This vacuum is formed by the collapse of the steam as it condenses,
        since the specific volume of water is so much less than the specific volume of steam. A
        properly operating main condenser operates at 28.5 in Hg vacuum or greater. </p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p> Vacuum will be maintained in the condenser as long as the shell of the condenser does not
        fill up with air or other gases, however vacuum tends to draw air into the condenser through
        any available leaks, such as those found at the <em>turbine glands</em> where the turbine
        shafts penetrate the turbine casing. This air must be pumped back out to the atmosphere as
        fast as it leaks in, or else vacuum will be lost. This is accomplished with a steam driven
        pump known as the <em>air ejector</em> which takes suction on top of the main condenser and

        water through the condenser tubes was interrupted, perhaps due to failure of the main
        circulating pump, blocked condenser tubes, or if the condensate pump failed which would
        cause the condenser to fill up with condensate. </p>

               <p> We <em>could</em> use a saltwater cooled condenser to condense this steam, but we don’t.
        Instead the coolant used is the condensate from the main condenser on its way back to the
        boiler. This is done for two reasons. First, the heat given up by the condensing air ejector
        steam preheats the condensate before it returns to the boiler, thus saving energy. Any heat
        added before the condensate reaches the boiler represents fuel that doesn’t need to be
        burned. Second, by cooling the air ejector condenser with condensate, there is no chance of

        ejector must operate in two stages to accomplish the necessary increase in pressure to move
        the air from the main condenser back to the atmosphere. As a result the condenser is also
        divided into two areas to maintain the pressure differential between the stages. The first
        condenser is known as the <em>inter-condenser</em>, and it discharges its condensate back to
        the main condenser. The second stage air ejector steam is condensed in the

               <p> An economizer or an air preheater will normally be found in a steam cycle, but not both.
        If both were present, they would tend to lower the exhaust gas temperature to the point
        where any water vapor in the exhaust would condense. While thermodynamically desirable, this
        introduces the practical problem that the condensed moisture combines with the other
        products of combustion to form a corrosive mixture of sulfuric acid in the exhaust. </p>

               <p> After leaving the economizer the feedwater enters the steam drum where the generation
        stage occurs, where the steam cycle begins again. </p>

<p> The simplified steam cycle uses a single turbine to extract power from the steam, but most
        ships use two turbines to do the same job. Two shorter turbine shafts are more advantageous
        than one large shaft for several reasons, including reduced manufacturing cost and increased
        flexibility in the arrangement of machinery in the engine room. </p>
<p> The first of these two turbines is known as the <em>high pressure turbine</em> (H.P.) and
        the second is the <em>low pressure turbine</em> (L.P.). A steam line, called the
          <em>crossover</em> carries steam from the outlet of the H.P. turbine to the inlet of the
        L.P. turbine. At normal operating speeds, the steam leaving the H.P. turbine and entering
        the crossover is at a pressure below atmospheric. </p>
<p> The H.P. and L.P. turbines together are known as the <em>Main Engine</em>. </p>

   <xref ref="simplified_png"/> shows a very simplified version of the steam cycle, which is an
        appropriate starting point for our discussion of ship’s propulsion. </p>
<p> The steam cycle is an example of what is known by engineers as a <em>cyclic heat
          engine</em>. It is called cyclic, because it operates on a cycle. It uses a <em>working
          fluid</em>, water, which travels from point to point through the cycle, changing form and
        carrying energy, but eventually returning to the starting point restored to the same
          <em>state</em> that it started with. It is called a heat engine, because it transforms
          <em>heat</em>, which is a form of energy, into <em>work</em>, another form of energy. The
        thermodynamic name for this cycle is the <em>Rankine Cycle.</em>
</p>
<p> The steam cycle consists of four stages </p>
<p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <p> generation </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> expansion </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> condensation </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> recovery </p>
      </li>
   </ol>
</p>
<p>Since this is a cycle, it has no beginning or end, but <em>we</em> have to start somewhere,
        so let’s begin with the generation stage.</p>

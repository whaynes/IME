<p> The <em>gland exhaust condenser</em> typically follows the air ejector condenser. This
        unit is used to condense any steam that leaks out of the turbine glands, in order to recover
        both the condensate and the heat. This is an example of the way a practical cycle takes
        every opportunity to recover <q>free</q> energy and increase the overall cycle efficiency.

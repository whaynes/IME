<p> Most screw type pumps consists of two to four intermeshing screws rotating in a
              closely fitted chamber. Liquid, trapped in the channels between the intermeshing
              screws, is pushed to the pump discharge as the thread of one screw rotates onto the
              channel of another screw. One screw, generally called the <em>power rotor</em>, is
              driven by an outside power source. The other screws, generally called <em>idler
                rotors</em>, have their shafts turned by timing gears or by direct contact between
              the intermeshing screw threads. </p>

<p> In this section you will find a brief description of the fluid flow paths through the
          Deaerator, as well as some considerations for the watch engineer as he operates the unit. </p>
<p>
   <term>Water Flow.</term> The condensate enters the tank through the tubes of the vent
          condenser at the top and is forced out through a number of stainless steel spray valves.
          The spray valves discharge the condensate in a fine conical spray throughout the steam
          filled upper preheater section of the tank. Most of the corrosive gases are removed here
          before the water strikes steel surfaces. This hot and partially deaerated water along with
          any condensed steam, drains down the conical baffle and into the deaerating unit, where it
          is vigorously scrubbed and heated by the entering oxygen-free steam. The thoroughly
          deaerated water then falls into the storage section in the bottom half of the tank. It
          remains there until it is pumped to the boiler by the feed pump. </p>
<p>
   <term>Steam Flow.</term> Auxiliary Exhaust Steam is used as the heating medium for the DC
          Heater. The pressure of the exhaust steam establishes pressure inside the DC Heater, and
          the temperature is the corresponding saturation pressure. For example, a plant operating
          with 33 psi auxiliary exhaust steam would produce feedwater at 270Â° F. A different exhaust
          pressure would mean a correspondingly different temperature, which can be determined from
          the saturated steam table. </p>
<p> Steam enters the deaerating unit through a check valve, and collides at high velocity
          with the heated and partially deaerated water in the scrubber section where it picks up
          the water and throws it tangentially outward through the curved baffles. In this process,
          the water is thoroughly scrubbed by the new incoming steam. As the steam gives up heat to
          the water most of it condenses. The condensate and condensed steam fall to a storage area,
          while the uncondensed steam and air rise up to heat the water in the preheating section. </p>
<p>
   <term>Air Flow.</term> Air and non-condensibles liberated in the scrubber and preheater
          sections, along with some entrained steam, rise up to the top of the DC Heater where they
          pass over the relatively cool tubes of the vent condenser. Here, most of the remaining
          steam is condensed and recovered. The remaining air and non-condensible gases accompanied
          by a tiny wisp of steam are discharged from the vent condenser, either directly to the
          atmosphere or to the gland exhaust condenser. </p>
<p>
   <term>Flashing Feed Pump.</term> The pressure in the shell of the DC Heater is the same as
          the pressure of the auxiliary exhaust steam used to heat it. Since a mixture of steam and
          water exists in the heater, the water temperature there will be approximately equal to the
          saturation temperature of steam at that pressure. This is necessary to achieve good
          deaeration, but it can lead to a problem. </p>
<p> The pressure at the suction of the feed pump depends on the pressure in the DC Heater
          and the vertical distance between the pump and the DC Heater. But as the feedwater flows
          to the feed pump, any slight pressure drop, for example caused by line friction or bends,
          will reduce the feedwater pressure below its saturation pressure and cause it to flash to
          steam. Since a centrifugal pump cannot pump a vapor, the feed pump will be unable to
          deliver water to the boiler and may overspeed and trip off the line. To avoid this, in
          merchant ships the DC Heater is always located high in the engine room and the feed pump
          low. This maximizes the weight of the water in the feed line, which raises the pressure,
          (technically the NPSH - <em>Net Positive Suction Head</em>), at the inlet of the feed
          pump. Every foot of head raises the water pressure by 0.433 psi, so a 45 foot difference
          in elevations between the DC Heater and the feed pump causes the feed pressure at the
          suction of the pump to be about 19 psi greater than the pressure in the DC Heater, which
          is normally sufficient to prevent flashing. Operators must take care not to let the water
          level in the DC Heater or the Auxiliary Exhaust Steam pressure fall too low, since both of
          these problems may lead to feed pump flashing. </p>
<p> In naval ships, it is often impossible to locate the DC Heater high in the engine room
          because of the compact design of the machinery spaces, so these plants are equipped with a
            <em>feed booster pump</em> between the DC Heater and the main feed pump. The booster
          pump raises the pressure of the feedwater and maintains a constant pressure at the suction
          of the feed pump to prevent flashing. </p>
<p>
   <term>Make Up Feed (MUF).</term> One of the functions of the DC Heater in the steam cycle
          is to store water. Water is also stored in two other locations in the steam cycle, the
          steam drum, and the main condenser hotwell. If the steam drum level and the hotwell level
          are constant, as they normally should be, then as water is added to or lost by the steam
          cycle, the level of the DC Heater will change. Because of leaks and losses in the system,
          the DC Heater level will normally fall slowly during the course of the day, and must be
          monitored by the watch officer. When the level falls, it is necessary to add <em>make-up
            feed</em> to replenish the system. </p>
<p> Make-up feed is stored in the make-up feed tanks or the reserve feed tanks and added to
          the steam cycle by vacuum drag into one of the condensers. When the ship is at sea, the
          main condenser is usually used. In port, with the main engine shut down, one of the
          auxiliary condensers would be used instead. On modern ships, the control of the make-up
          feed and the level in the DC Heater are maintained automatically, but it may be necessary
          for the watch engineer to take over and add make-up feed manually if the regulator fails. </p>
<p> Occasionally the level in the DC Heater gets too high. This should not happen, but if it
          does it must be lowered back to normal. The condensate system is fitted with a valve and
          line which exits the steam cycle and starves the DC Heater of water. This line directs the
          discharge of the condensate pump to a reserve feed tank, instead of the DC Heater, until
          the level comes down. This is sometimes referred to as dumping the DC Heater or DC Heater
          starvation. </p>
<p> When taking on make-up feed, you must take care not to introduce too much cold water
          into the DC Heater too fast. If you do, you may overwhelm the ability of the auxiliary
          exhaust steam line to supply enough steam to maintain the pressure in the DC Heater. All
          of the entering steam will immediately condense, and the result will be a rapid drop in
          the shell pressure of the DC Heater, which will lead to a drop in pressure at the suction
          of the feed pump and possible flashing and overspeeding. This same problem can occur when
          you use a condensate pump to pump out the hotwell of an idle condenser. </p>

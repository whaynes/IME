<p> The process of generating steam is basically simple. You boil water and continue to add heat
      until the water turns into steam. But how can this steam cause a ship to move through the
      water? How can steam provide power for steering, ventilation, refrigeration, distillation of
      seawater, and all the other needs of the vessel? </p>
<p> Steam does not do any of these things directly. But some of the thermal energy contained in
      the steam can be converted into other forms of energy to move the ship through the water and
      to provide power for vital shipboard services. </p>
<p> In this chapter we will discuss some basic ideas of energy and some of the important energy
      transformations that occur in the engineering plant of a steam-driven ship. Study this chapter
      carefully. The information given here will not help you to light off a boiler, clean
      firesides, stand a watch, or wipe up oil from the floorplates; however, it will help you to
      understand the generation of steam, the use of steam in the shipboard engineering plant, and
      the relationship of the boilers to the rest of the engineering plant. Understanding the
      information given in this chapter will also give you a sound background for understanding some
      of the more complicated things that you will have to learn as you advance. </p>
<p> As you study this chapter, watch out for unfamiliar definitions. Many of the words and terms
      used will be familiar to you, but the definitions we use may be more precise than the ones you
      have heard before. Be sure that you understand the exact meaning of each word and term used in
      connection with energy and energy transformations. </p>

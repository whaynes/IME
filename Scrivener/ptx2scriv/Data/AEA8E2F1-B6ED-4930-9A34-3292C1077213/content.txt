<p> The machinery and equipment in the engineering plant aboard ship is designed either to
        carry energy from one place to another or to change a substance from one form to another.
        The principles of energy transformations and some of the important energy changes that occur
        in the shipboard propulsion cycle are discussed here. </p>

<p>Fuel cells are similar toÂ·batteries but supply power continuously because the electrolyte
        is continuously rejuvenated. This rejuvenation is achieved by continuously adding hydrogen
        and oxygen to the electrolyte. Fuel cells operating on pure hydrogen have been used in space
        vehicles for years, but advancing technology will allow fuel cell systems to operate on less
        expensive, readily available hydrocarbon fuels from which the hydrogen can be separated.
        Fuel-cell systems have the potential to achieve efficiencies higher than those based on
        engine-driven generators. </p>

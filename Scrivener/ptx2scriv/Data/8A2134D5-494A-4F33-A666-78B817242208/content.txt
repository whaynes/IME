   <term>Generators</term> are machines for producing DC electric power, while alternators are
        machines that produce AC power. It is common to refer to alternators as generators. Aboard
        ship generators and alternators are rotating machines driven by engines or turbines, serving
        as the normal source of electricity, and on larger vessels, for standby and emergency
        electric power as well.</p>
<p>When a conductor is passed through a magnetic field, or when a magnetic field is passed
        over a conductor, an <term>electromotive force</term> or <term>impressed voltage</term> is
        induced in the conductor. If the conductor is part of a complete circuit, the current that
        will then flow is called an <term>induced current</term>. The linkage of relative motion
        between a magnetic field and a conductor, and the resulting impressed voltage and induced
        current, is the principle behind generators and alternators. In a generator, conductors are
        arranged on the rotor, driven through a stationary magnetic field by a prime mover, with the
        induced current collected from the rotor for delivery to the load. In most alternators, the
        conductors are stationary, and surround a rotating magnetic field: current is induced in the
        stationary conductors as they are swept by the magnetic field.</p>

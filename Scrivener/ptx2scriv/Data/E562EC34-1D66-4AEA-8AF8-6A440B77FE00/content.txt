<p> You will also find another kind of pressure unit, which appears to be a length. These
        units include inches of water, inches of mercury (Hg), or the height of some other liquid of
        known density. These units, while measured in length units, still represent a pressure. The
        length describes the pressure exerted by a column of liquid of the given height, and is
        known as the <em>head</em>. For example, a pressure reading of 1 inch of water (1 in. H₂O)
        means that the exerted pressure is equal to the pressure exerted by a column of water 1 inch
        high, or that a column of water in a U-tube would be displaced 1 inch by the pressure being
        measured. Similarly, a reading of 12 inches of mercury (12 in. Hg) means that the measured
        pressure is sufficient to support a column of mercury 12 inches high. What is really being
        expressed (even though it is not mentioned in the pressure unit) is the fact that a certain
        quantity of material (water, mercury, etc.) of known density will exert a certain definite
        force upon a specified area. Pressure is still force per unit area even if the pressure unit
        refers to the height of some liquid. </p>

<p> The gerotor mechanism consists of pair of gear shaped elements, one within the
              other, mounted in a pump chamber, see <xref ref="gerotor_png"/>. The inner gear is
              directly connected to the drive shaft and the source of power, and drives the outer
              gear through direct contact. The inner gear has one fewer teeth than the outer gear.
              The tooth form of each gear is related to that of the other in such a way that each
              tooth of the inner gear is always in sliding contact with the surface of the outer
              gear. Each meshing pair of teeth only fully engages at one point, 12 oâ€™clock in the
              figure above. </p>
<p> On one side of the point of mesh, pockets of increasing size are formed as the gears
              rotate (suction pockets), while the pockets on the other side decrease in size
              (discharge pockets). </p>

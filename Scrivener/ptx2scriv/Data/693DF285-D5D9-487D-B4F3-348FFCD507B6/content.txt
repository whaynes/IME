<p> Steam collected in the dry pipe is directed to the superheater section of the boiler,
        where its temperature is raised beyond the saturation temperature to improve the efficiency
        of the steam cycle. </p>
<p> The superheater is a bank of boiler tubes located in the hottest portions of the
        combustion gas path. Since there is no liquid water in the superheater, all heat added there
        is sensible heat. It is important to always maintain a flow of steam through the superheater
        tubes, or else the tubes would quickly overheat and melt. </p>

<p> The dry pipe is located inside the steam drum, near the top. In its simplest form the dry
        pipe is simply a pipe with holes drilled into the top portion. Steam enters the dry pipe
        before it leaves the boiler. </p>
<p> The dry pipe is designed to allow steam to enter, but to exclude water droplets and
        moisture. Moisture in the steam, known as <em>carryover</em> is bad, because high velocity
        water droplets in the steam would cause damage to the blades and thrust bearings in the
        turbine. Improper operation of the boiler, for instance letting the steam drum water level
        get too high, could cause carryover. </p>

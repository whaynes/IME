<p>Batteries and fuel cells are electro-chemical, direct-current power supplies. Batteries
        provide power for finite periods of time before they are replaced or recharged. Aboard ship,
        batteries are used as power supplies for portable equipment, as temporary emergency-power
        sources, and for starting small auxiliary engines. On the other hand, fuel cells are
        continuous power sources, and while not yet in use aboard ship, they are considered a
        likely, near-future alternative to generators.</p>

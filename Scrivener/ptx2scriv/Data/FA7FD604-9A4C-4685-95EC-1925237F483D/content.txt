<p> While the simplified steam cycle discussed in the previous section could be built, and it
        would work, several modifications are required to make it practical and to improve its
        efficiency. This practical steam cycle is shown in <xref ref="MainSteamCycle_png"/>. Each of
        the components of this cycle will be briefly discussed in the following sections, in its
        order in the cycle, and a more detailed discussion of the major components will be found in
        the chapters to follow. </p>

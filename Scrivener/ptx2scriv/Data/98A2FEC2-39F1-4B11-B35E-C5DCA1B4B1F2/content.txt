<p> In interpreting pressure measurements, a great deal of confusion arises because the zero
        point on most pressure gages represents atmospheric pressure rather than zero absolute
        pressure, and both pressure and head scales are used. Thus it is important to specify the
        kind of pressure being measured under given conditions. To clarify the numerous meanings of
        the word pressure, the relationship among gage pressure, atmospheric pressure, vacuum, and
        absolute pressure is illustrated in <xref ref="PressureRelations_png"/>. </p>

<p> If you can remember the following facts, it is relatively easy to perform unit conversions
        between the various pressure scales. </p>

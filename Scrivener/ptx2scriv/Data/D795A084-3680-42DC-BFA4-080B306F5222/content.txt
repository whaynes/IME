<p> Radiation is a mode of heat transfer that does not require any physical contact
            between the warmer substance and the cooler substance. For example, a person sitting
            near a hot stove is warmed by radiant heat even though the air between the person and
            the stove may remain cold. Similarly, radiant heat from the sun warms the earth without
            warming the space through which it passes. </p>

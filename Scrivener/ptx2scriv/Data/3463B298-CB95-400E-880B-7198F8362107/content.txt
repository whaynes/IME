<p>In construction, DC motors are similar to DC generators. The traditional advantage that DC
        motors have had over AC motors is that, unlike AC motors, their speed can be easily
        controlled over a wide range by a <term>rheostat</term>. A rheostat is an easily adjusted
        variable resistor that can be connected in series with the motor field windings to control
        field current and, therefore, motor speed. However, solid-state electronic controls like
        variable frequency converters are now available, allowing AC motors to be operated with
        variable speed. Consequently, few DC motors are found aboard modern ships.</p>

<p> The L.P. turbine follows the H.P. turbine and continues to extract energy from the steam.
        The steam enters at a low pressure (a vacuum actually, at low loads) and exits at an even
        lower pressure into the main condenser. The specific volume of steam at these low pressures
        is large, which means that the turbine blades and the L.P. turbine itself are also large.
        When looking at the two turbines, it is always easy to identify the L.P. turbine because of
        its size; eight to ten feet in diameter is not unusual. </p>
<p> Steam leaves the L.P. turbine as saturated steam, so you can determine the steam
        temperature by looking up the saturation temperature for the condenser pressure in the steam
        tables. For example, if the condenser pressure is 28.9 in Hg vacuum, this corresponds to an
        absolute pressure of 0.5 psia, and this has a saturation temperature of about 80 °F. Are you
        surprised? Steam isn’t always hot… it depends on the pressure. </p>
<p> The forward end of the L.P. Turbine rotor contains the <em>Astern Elements</em>. These are
        two or three rows of blades designed to rotate the shaft in the astern direction. Since
        there are so few rows of astern blades, the power the turbine is capable of producing in the
        astern direction is limited. </p>

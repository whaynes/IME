<p>If a two-pole generator were fitted with three sets of windings on the stator, as in <xref ref="fig_24_10_png"/>, a three-phase alternator results. The windings are positioned 120
        degrees apart and are not connected to each other. As the poles of the field rotate a
        sinusoidal voltage is induced in turn in each winding, 120 degrees out of phase with the
        voltage produced in the adjacent windings. Each winding has one end connected to a common
        ground, and the voltages that result, <m>V_1</m>, <m>V_2</m>, and <m>V_3</m>, measured
        relative to ground, are shown in <xref ref="fig_24_11_png"/>.</p>

<p>With alternating current, the electron flow is opposed not only by the resistance but also
        by an additional factor, the reactance. Reactance is caused by the response of the circuit
        to the cyclic fluctuations of the alternating current and voltage, and may be further
        categorized as inductive reactance or capacitive reactance. The sum of the resistance and
        the reactance is the <term>impedance</term>
   <m>Z</m>, and has units of ohms. Impedance is defined as: <me>Z= E/I</me>
</p>
<p>The magnitude of the impedance depends on factors that include the characteristics of the
        components in the circuit and the frequency of the current.</p>

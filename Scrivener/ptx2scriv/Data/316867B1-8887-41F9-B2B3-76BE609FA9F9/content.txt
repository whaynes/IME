<p>If we replace the compass needle in the above example with a more powerful magnet, the
        magnetic field produced by this magnet would lock onto the rotating magnetic field produced
        by the stator windings. The rotor can be a strong permanent magnet or an electromagnet
        supplied (excited) by a DC source. This type of AC motor is called a <term>synchronous
          motor</term> and is characterized by the fact that the rotor rotates at the same speed as
        the magnetic field produced by the stator windings, the synchronous speed. Synchronous
        motors range in size from small motors for electric clocks fitted with permanent-magnet
        rotors, to very large propulsion motors, developing 70,000 HP or more, with electromagnetic
        rotors.</p>

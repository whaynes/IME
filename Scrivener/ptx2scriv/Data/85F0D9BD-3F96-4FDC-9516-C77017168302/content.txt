<p> The basic principle dealing with the transformation of energy is the <em>Principle of
          Conservation of Energy</em>. This principle can be stated in several ways. Most commonly,
        perhaps, it is stated: <q>Energy can be neither destroyed nor created, but only
          transformed.</q> Another way to state this principle is: <q>The total quantity of energy
          in the universe is always the same.</q> Still another way of expressing this principle is
        by the equation </p>
<p>
   <me>\mathrm{Energy}_{in} = \mathrm{Energy}_{out}</me>
</p>
<p> The <q>energy out</q> may be quite different in form from the <q>energy in,</q> but the
        total amount of energy input must always equal the total amount of energy output. </p>
<p> Another principle, the <em>Principle of Conservation of Matter,</em> states: <q>Matter can
          be neither created nor destroyed, but only transformed.</q> As you probably know, the
        development of the atomic bomb demonstrated that matter can be converted into energy; other
        developments have demonstrated that energy can be converted into matter. Therefore, the
        Principle of the Conservation of Energy and the Principle of the Conservation of Matter are
        no longer considered as two parts of a single law or principle but are combined into one
        principle: “Matter and energy are interchangeable, and the total amount of energy and matter
        in the universe is constant." </p>
<p> The interchangeability of matter and energy is mentioned here only to point out that the
        statement <q>energy in must equal energy out</q> is not strictly true for certain
        situations. However, any noticeable conversion of matter into energy or energy into matter
        can occur only under very special conditions that we need not consider now. All the energy
        transformations that we will deal with can be understood quite simply if we consider only
        the Principle of the Conservation of Energy, that is, <em>Energy in must equal Energy
          out</em>. </p>

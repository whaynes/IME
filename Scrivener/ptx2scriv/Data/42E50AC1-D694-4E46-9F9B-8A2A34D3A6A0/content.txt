<p> The energy transformation of primary interest in the shipboard steam plant is the
        transformation from heat to work. To see how this transformation occurs, we need to consider
        the pressure, temperature, and volume relationships which hold true for gases. These
        relationships may be summarized as follows: </p>
<p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <p> When the temperature is held constant, increasing the pressure on a gas causes a
              proportional decrease in volume. Decreasing the pressure causes a proportional
              increase in volume. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> When the pressure is held constant, increasing the temperature of a gas causes a
              proportional increase in volume. Decreasing the temperature causes a proportional
              decrease in volume. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> When the volume is held constant, increasing the temperature of a gas causes a
              proportional increase in pressure. Decreasing the temperature causes a proportional
              decrease in pressure. </p>
      </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p> Suppose we have a boiler in which steam has just begun to form. With the steam stop valves
        still closed, the volume of the steam remains constant while the temperature and the
        pressure are both increasing. When operating pressure is reached and the steam stop valves
        are opened, the high pressure of the steam causes the steam to flow to the turbines. The
        pressure of the steam thus provides the potential for doing work; the actual conversion of
        heat to work is done in the steam turbines. The change in the internal energy (as indicated
        by changes in pressure and temperature) of the steam between the boiler and the condenser is
        an indication of the amount of heat that has been converted to work in the turbines. </p>
<p> Since heat is measured in BTU and work is measured in foot-pounds, how can we compare the
        amount of energy put in as heat with the amount of energy put out as work? At first glance,
        asking how much heat equals how much work might seem like asking how many lima beans equals
        playing baseball. However, the problem is not that difficult, since both heat and work are
        forms of energy. The formula for converting heat to work is </p>
<p>
   <me>1 \text{ BTU} = 778 \text{ ft-lb}</me>
</p>
<p> or, in other words, the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of
        water 1 Â°F is the same as the amount of energy required to lift a 1-pound weight 778 feet
        against the force of gravity. </p>

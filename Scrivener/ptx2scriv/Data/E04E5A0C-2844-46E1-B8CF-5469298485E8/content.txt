<p> You are probably already familiar with temperature, and know that we use is it to
          describe how hot or cold an object is, but what, exactly is it? Temperature is not energy
          and itâ€™s not heat. It is simply a number related to the average kinetic energy of the
          molecules of a substance; the greater the average kinetic energy, the greater the
          temperature. Notice that temperature is not equal to the kinetic energy, just proportional
          to it, and temperature readings do not tell you anything directly about the potential
          energy of the substance. </p>
<p> Temperature can be measured in a variety of scales. When the temperature scale is
          measured up from the point where there is no molecular motion, it is known as an absolute
          scale, and is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the
          substance. The Kelvin and Rankine scales are absolute scales. We normally use the
          Fahrenheit or Celsius scales, which are offset from the corresponding absolute scale, and
          so are only indirectly related to the kinetic energy. </p>

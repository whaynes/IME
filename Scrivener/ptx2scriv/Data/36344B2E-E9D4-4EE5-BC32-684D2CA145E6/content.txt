<p> A <em>positive displacement</em> pump is one in which a definite volume of liquid is
            delivered for each cycle of pump operation, regardless of the discharge pressure the
            pump operates against, and provided the capacity of the power unit driving the pump is
            not exceeded. </p>
<p> A non-positive displacement pump is one in which the volume of liquid delivered for
            each operational pump cycle depends on the resistance to flow in the discharge line.
            This type of pump produces a force on the liquid that is constant for each particular
            operating speed of the pump. Pressure in the discharge line produces a force in the
            opposite direction. When these two forces are equal, the liquid is in a state of
            equilibrium and does not flow. </p>
<p> If the discharge valve of a positive displacement pump is completely closed, the
            discharge pressure will rise to a point where either the unit driving the pump will
            stall or parts of the pump exposed to discharge pressure will fail. This situation
            should be avoided. On the other hand, closing the discharge valve on a non-positive
            displacement pump will cause the discharge pressure to rise to a maximum for that type
            of pump operating at a specific speed. Nothing more will happen except the pump will
            churn the liquid trapped in the pump chamber and produce frictional heat in the liquid. </p>
<p> Most positive displacement pumps deliver liquid in slugs, with no delivery in between,
            and this causes a rise then a drop in discharge pressure and flow. Pumps equipped with
            many small pumping chambers generally have overlapping delivery that minimizes this
            effect. Non-positive displacement pumps deliver a practically continuous even flow for a
            given operating speed and discharge pressure. </p>

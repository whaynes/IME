<p>Although most large motors aboard ship are supplied with three-phase power, smaller motors,
        such as those driving appliances, must operate from single-phase circuits.
          <term>Single-phase motors</term> are most often arranged with two sets of stator windings,
        with the second set supplied from the line connections through a <term>capacitor</term>. The
        capacitor imposes a phase shift on the line current reaching these windings, to make it look
        like two-phase AC current. The stator is thus able to develop a rotating magnetic field to
        drive a rotor.</p>

<p> The feed pump serves the same purpose here as it does in the simplified cycle; that is, it
        raises the pressure of the feedwater sufficiently to force it into the boiler to begin the
        cycle again. </p>
<p> The feed pump is usually a turbine driven centrifugal pump, and the discharge pressure is
        about 50 to 100 psi above the pressure in the steam drum. </p>

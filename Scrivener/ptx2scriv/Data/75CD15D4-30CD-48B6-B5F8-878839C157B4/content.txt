<p> Can you define energy? Although everyone has a general idea of the meaning of energy, a
        good definition is hard to find. Most commonly, perhaps, energy is defined as the <q>ability
          of a system to do work.</q> This is not a very complete definition. Energy can produce
        other effects which cannot possibly be considered <q>work.</q> For example, heat can flow
        from one object to another without doing work; yet heat is a form of energy, and the process
        of heat transfer is a process that produces an effect. </p>
<p> A better definition of energy, therefore, states that <q>energy is the capacity for
          producing an effect.</q> Energy exists in many forms. For convenience, we usually classify
        energy according to the size and nature of the bodies or particles with which it is
        associated. Thus we say that <em>Mechanical energy</em> is the energy associated with large
        bodies or objects, usually, things that are big enough to see. <em>Thermal energy</em> is
        energy associated with molecules. <em>Chemical energy</em> is energy that arises from the
        forces which bind the atoms together in a molecule, Chemical energy is demonstrated whenever
        combustion or any other chemical reaction takes place. <em>Electro-magnetic</em> energy is
        energy that is associated with the electron and charged particles. Light, x-rays and radio
        waves are examples of electro-magnetic energy. <em>Nuclear energy</em> is associated with
        the particles in the nucleus, and is governed by Einstein’s famous equation <m>E = mc^2</m>
</p>
<p> Each of these types of energy (mechanical energy, thermal energy, etc.) must also be
        classified as being either stored energy, or energy in transition. </p>
<p>
   <em>Stored energy</em> can be thought of as energy that is actually <q>contained in</q> or
          <q>stored in</q> a substance or system. There are two kinds of stored energy: potential
        energy, and kinetic energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the
        relative <em>positions</em> of two or more objects or particles, we call it potential
        energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the relative
          <em>velocities</em> of two or more objects or particles, we call it kinetic energy. </p>

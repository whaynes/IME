   <p> Assume that steam has formed in a boiler in which all of the steam stop valves are
          closed, and the water level is held constant. When there is an increase in the temperature
          of the steam and water in the boiler, which of the following effects will occur on the
          pressure and the specific volume of the steam? </p>

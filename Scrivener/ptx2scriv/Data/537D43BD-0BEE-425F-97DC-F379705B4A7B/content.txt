<p> The steam drum is located near the top of the boiler and should normally be half filled
        with water and the remainder filled with steam. A <em>gage glass</em> on the steam drum
        allows the operator to determine the water level in the boiler. Too little water would be
        very dangerous, because without water in the boiler the heat of the flames would melt the
        boiler tubes and destroy the boiler. </p>
<p> Steam is formed in the boiler tubes, and since steam bubbles are less dense than the
        surrounding liquid water, they float up to the top of the boiler and eventually rise above
        the surface of the water in the steam drum. If the steam was allowed to build up in the
        drum, the boiler pressure would quickly rise, and if not relieved by the safety valves,
        would cause the boiler to explode. The system is designed to remove steam as quickly as it
        is created, so a properly operated boiler will maintain a constant pressure. </p>

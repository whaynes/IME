   <ol>
      <li>
         <p> Rotate the pump by hand to insure it is free to turn. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> If the pump has a packed shaft and is to operate with a high vacuum on the
                    suction side, open the seal water line to the stuffing box (if fitted with a
                    valve), and the suction vent line to remove vapors from the suction casing. On a
                    high speed boiler feed pump, open the recirculating line. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> Open the suction valve and close the discharge valve. </p>
      </li>
   </ol>
</p>
<p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <p> Prime or flood the pump casing with liquid. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> Start the pump prime mover. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> As the pump comes up to running speed, briefly open the casing vent valve (if
                    installed) to expel any air from the casing. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> When the pump is up to its normal running speed, open the discharge valve.
                  </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> Check the suction and discharge pressure gages to insure the pump is operating
                    normally and make sure a packed pump shaft has a small amount of liquid leakage.
                  </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p> After the pump has run for a little while, check the casing, stuffing box area
                    (on a packed pump), and the bearing housings for excessive temperatures. </p>
      </li>
   </ol>

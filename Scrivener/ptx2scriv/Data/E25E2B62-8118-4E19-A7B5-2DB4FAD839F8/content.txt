   <em>Head</em> is defined as the vertical distance between two liquid levels. Head, for a
            pump, is simply the distance, measured in <q>feet of fresh water,</q> between the pump
            suction connection centerline and the liquid level in the supply tank, or between the
            pump discharge connection centerline and the liquid level in the discharge tank. Static
            head in feet can be related to the pressure that the pump must generate in the fluid to
            create these differences in liquid levels. Static head also influences the output
            capacity of the pump. </p>
<p> When discussing pumps, we are always referring to <em>static head</em>. In other
            engineering courses, you will learn about other types of head. For example, in Fluid
            Mechanics, you will calculate the pressure necessary to overcome friction in the
            pipelines, called <em>friction head</em>, and the pressure required to impart velocity
            to the fluid, known as <em>velocity head</em>. </p>

<p> Head can also be thought of as the pressure necessary to support a column of water of
            a height equal to the head. Since head can be related to pressure, you may be wondering
            how atmospheric pressure effects the pump. Usually there is no effect at all. Since
            atmospheric pressure acts on the surface of the liquid in both the suction and discharge
            tanks, the effect is equal but in opposite directions on each side of the pump, and the
            result is that the net effect of the atmospheric pressure on the pump, is canceled out. </p>
<p> Several different head measurements are used to describe the operation of a pump. The
            relationship between these heads is illustrated in <xref ref="static_head_png"/>. </p>

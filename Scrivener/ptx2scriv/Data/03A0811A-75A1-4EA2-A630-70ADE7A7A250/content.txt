<p> A steam strainer is located in the steam line upstream of the main engine to prevent
        objects other than steam from entering the turbines, since solid objects impacting the
        turbine blades would quickly destroy them. Steam lines would normally be expected to be
        quite clean, but a strainer is cheap insurance against nuts, tools, and gloves left in the
        lines by shipyard workers, or rust flakes formed during a layup period. Unfortunately, water
        droplets due to wet steam or carryover will pass through the steam strainer. </p>

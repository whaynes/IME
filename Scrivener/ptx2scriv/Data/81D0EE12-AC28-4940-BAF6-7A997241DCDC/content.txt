<p> Conduction is the method by which heat flows from a hotter to a colder substance when
            there is physical contact between the two substances. For example, consider a cold metal
            bar which is held firmly against a piece of red-hot metal. In a short time, the end of
            the bar which is not touching the hotter metal will have become too hot to hold. We say
            that heat has been conducted from molecule to molecule, throughout the entire bar. The
            process of conduction will continue as long as there is a temperature difference between
            the two ends of the bar. </p>

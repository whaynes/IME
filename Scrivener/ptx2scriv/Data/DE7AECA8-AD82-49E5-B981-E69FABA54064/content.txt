<p> Let’s consider first the two stored forms of mechanical energy. </p>
<p> Mechanical <em>potential</em> energy exists because of the relative positions of two or
        more objects. For example, a rock resting on the edge of a cliff in such a position that it
        will fall freely if pushed has mechanical potential energy. Water at the top of a dam has
        mechanical potential energy. A sled that is being held at the top of an icy hill has
        mechanical potential energy. </p>
<p> Mechanical <em>kinetic</em> energy exists because of the relative velocities of two or
        more objects. If you push that rock, open the gate of the dam, or let go of the sled,
        something will move. The rock will fall; the water will flow; the sled will slide down the
        hill. In each case the mechanical potential energy will be changed to mechanical kinetic
        energy. Another way of saying this is <q>energy of position will be changed to energy of
          motion.</q>
</p>
<p> In these examples, you will notice that an external source of energy is used to get things
        started. Energy from some outside source is required to push the rock, open the gate of the
        dam, or let go of the sled. All real machines and processes require this kind of
          <q>boost</q> from an energy source outside the system. For example, there is a tremendous
        amount of chemical energy stored in fuel oil; but this energy will not raise steam in the
        boiler until you have expended some energy to start the oil burning. Similarly, the energy
        in any one system affects other energy systems. However, it is easier to learn the basic
        principles of energy if we forget about all the energy systems that might be involved in or
        affected by each energy process. In the examples given in this chapter, therefore, we will
        consider only one energy process or energy system at a time, disregarding both the energy
          <q>boosts</q> that may be received from outside systems and the energy transfers that may
        take place between the system we are considering and other systems. </p>
<p> Notice that both mechanical potential energy and mechanical kinetic energy are stored
        forms of energy. It is easy to see why we regard mechanical potential energy as being
        stored, but it is not so easy to see the same thing about mechanical kinetic energy. Part of
        the trouble comes about because mechanical kinetic energy is often referred to as <q>the
          energy of motion,</q> thus leading to the false conclusion that <q>energy in
          transition</q> is somehow involved. This is not the case, however. Work is the only form
        of mechanical energy that can be properly considered as energy in transition. </p>
<p> If you have trouble with the idea that mechanical kinetic energy is stored, rather than in
        transition, think of it like this. A bullet that has been fired from a gun has mechanical
        kinetic energy because it is in motion. The faster the bullet is moving, the more kinetic
        energy it has. There is no doubt in anybody’s mind that the bullet has the capacity to
        produce an effect, so we may safely say that it has energy. Although the bullet is in
        transition, the energy of the bullet is not transferred to any other object or system until
        the bullet strikes some object which resists its passage. When the bullet strikes against a
        resisting object, then, and only then, can we say that energy in transition exists, in the
        form of heat and work. </p>
<p> In this example, we are ignoring the fact that some work is done against the resistance of
        the air and that some heat results from the passage of the bullet through the air. But this
        does not change the basic idea that kinetic energy is stored energy rather than energy in
        transition. The air must merely be regarded as a <q>resisting object</q> which causes some
        of the stored kinetic energy of the bullet to be converted into energy in transition (heat
        and work) while the bullet is passing through the air. However, the major part of the stored
        kinetic energy does not become energy in transition until the bullet strikes an object
        firmer than air which resists its passage. </p>
<p> In the English system of units, mechanical potential energy is measured in foot-pounds.
        Consider, for example, the rock at the top of the cliff. If the rock weighs 5 pounds and if
        the distance from the rock to the earth at the base of the cliff is 100 feet, 500
        foot-pounds of mechanical potential energy exist because of the relative positions of the
        rock and the earth. Another way of expressing this idea is by the formula: </p>
<p>
   <me>PE = mgh</me>
</p>
<p> Where: <ul marker="">
      <li>
         <p>
            <m>PE</m> = potential energy (in foot-pounds)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>
            <m>mg</m> = total weight of the object (in pounds)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>
            <m>h</m> = distance between the earth and the object (in feet) </p>
      </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p> Mechanical kinetic energy is also measured in foot-pounds. The amount of kinetic energy
        present at any one time is directly related to the velocity of the moving object and to the
        weight of the moving object. </p>
<p>
   <me>KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2</me>
</p>
<p> Where: <ul marker="">
      <li>
         <p>
            <m>KE</m> = Kinetic energy</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>
            <m>m</m> = Mass of object</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>
            <m>v</m> = Velocity of object relative to earth </p>
      </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p> Mechanical potential energy can be changed into mechanical kinetic energy. If you push
        that 5-pound rock over the edge of the 100-foot cliff, it begins to fall, and, as it falls,
        it loses potential energy and gains kinetic energy. At any given moment, the total amount of
        mechanical energy (potential plus kinetic) stored in the system is the same - that is, 500
        foot-pounds. But the proportions of potential energy and kinetic energy are changing all the
        time as the rock is falling. Just before the rock hits the earth, all the stored mechanical
        energy is kinetic energy. As the rock hits the earth, the kinetic energy is changed into
        energy in transition-that is, work and heat. </p>
<p> Mechanical kinetic energy can likewise be changed into mechanical potential energy. For
        example, suppose you throw a baseball straight up in the air. The ball has kinetic energy
        while it is motion, but the amount of kinetic energy decreases and the amount of potential
        energy increases as the ball travels upward. When the ball has reached its uppermost
        position, just before it starts to fall back to earth, it has only potential energy. Then,
        as it falls back toward the earth, the potential energy is changed into kinetic energy
        again. </p>

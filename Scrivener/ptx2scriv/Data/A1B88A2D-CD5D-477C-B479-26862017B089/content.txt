   <em>Net static head</em> is the distance the pump has to raise the pumped fluid between
            the liquid level in the supply tank to the liquid level in the discharge tank. </p>
<blockquote>
   <p> Net static head = Static Discharge Head - Static Gravity Head </p>
   <p> Net static head = Static Discharge Head + Static Suction Lift </p>

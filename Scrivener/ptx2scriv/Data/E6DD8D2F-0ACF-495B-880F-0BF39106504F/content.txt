<p> The air ejector, as mentioned above, is a steam powered air pump which is used to remove
        air leakage from the condenser. Since the air ejector operates on steam, and normally draws
        out some steam along with the air it removes, it is important to recover this steam in a
        condenser so that it is not lost from the steam cycle. </p>
<p> We <em>could</em> use a saltwater cooled condenser to condense this steam, but we don’t.
        Instead the coolant used is the condensate from the main condenser on its way back to the
        boiler. This is done for two reasons. First, the heat given up by the condensing air ejector
        steam preheats the condensate before it returns to the boiler, thus saving energy. Any heat
        added before the condensate reaches the boiler represents fuel that doesn’t need to be
        burned. Second, by cooling the air ejector condenser with condensate, there is no chance of
        contaminating the condensate with saltwater in the event of a tube leak. </p>
<p> A typical air ejector condenser is shown in <xref ref="air_ejector_vw_png"/>. The air
        ejector must operate in two stages to accomplish the necessary increase in pressure to move
        the air from the main condenser back to the atmosphere. As a result the condenser is also
        divided into two areas to maintain the pressure differential between the stages. The first
        condenser is known as the <em>inter-condenser</em>, and it discharges its condensate back to
        the main condenser. The second stage air ejector steam is condensed in the
          <em>after-condenser</em> and the condensate collected there is returned to the system by
        way of the <em>atmospheric drain tank</em>. </p>

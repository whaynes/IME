<p> According to US Coast Guard regulations, boilers are required to have <em>two valve
          protection</em>, that is, they are required to have two valves in series in all boiler
        connections. This insures that at least one valve will be functional when the time comes to
        secure the boiler. </p>
<p> The bulkhead stop valve is located in the main steam line, downstream of the main steam
        stop valve, and provides backup protection for it. </p>

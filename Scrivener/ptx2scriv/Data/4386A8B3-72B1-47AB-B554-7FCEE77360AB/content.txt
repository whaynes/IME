<p> Heat can flow from one substance to another only when a temperature difference exists.
          Heat flow can occur only from a higher temperature to a lower temperature. When two
          objects at different temperatures are placed in contact with each other (or near each
          other), heat flows from the warmer object to the cooler one until both are at the same
          temperature. Heat transfer occurs at a faster rate when there is a larger temperature
          difference between the two objects. As the temperature difference approaches zero, the
          rate of heat transfer approaches zero. </p>
<p> Conduction, radiation, and convection are usually considered to be the three methods by
          which heat transfer can occur. It is more accurate, however, to consider conduction and
          radiation as the two basic methods of heat transfer and to consider convection separately
          as a special process which involves movement within a mass of fluid. </p>

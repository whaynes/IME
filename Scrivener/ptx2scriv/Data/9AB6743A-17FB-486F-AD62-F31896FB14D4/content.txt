<p> Hundreds of different types of pumps have been invented and improved over the years to
            meet every conceivable pumping requirement. These pumps differ in principles of
            operation and in design details; nevertheless, they may be broadly categorized according
            to their displacement characteristics, their delivery characteristics, and their suction
            characteristics. These broad categories are described in this section. </p>

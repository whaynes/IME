<p>An electron flow, or current, is always surrounded by a magnetic field. When a conductor is
        wound into a cylindrical coil, the magnetic field that will be formed will be oriented along
        the axis of the cylinder. One end of the coil will act like the north pole of a permanent
        magnet, and the other end, like the south pole. The coil is therefore an

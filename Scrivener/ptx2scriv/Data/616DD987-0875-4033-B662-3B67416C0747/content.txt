<p> No practical boiler could function without valves. Valves permit the operator to control
        fluid flow, and to isolate sections of the system for maintenance. There are dozens of
        valves used in the main steam cycle but in this discussion we will only mention a few of
        them. You may assume that valves are located throughout the system wherever they are
        necessary. </p>
<p> The main steam stop valve is located at the outlet of the superheater, and it is the
        primary valve used to connect or isolate the boiler from the remainder of the steam cycle.
        Specially designed valves are required for this service, because of the extreme differences
        of temperature encountered when cutting-in a boiler. Bypass lines are usually installed here
        to assist with warming up the main steam stop valve. </p>

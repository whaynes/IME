<p> The diagram shown in <xref ref="ts_png"/> is an idealized representation of the Rankine
        Cycle used in the study of thermodynamics, and known as a Temperature-entropy diagram. The
        heavy dome shaped curve is known as the <em>vapor dome</em> and points under the curve are
        saturated steam, while points to the left of the curve are liquid water and points to the
        right of the curve are superheated steam. </p>
<p> Feedwater enters the boiler at point <m>1</m>, and is heated by the fuel. Initially, the
        water temperature rises, until it reaches the saturation temperature for the boiler
        pressure, point <m>1_f</m>, where the water begins to boil. Additional heat added at this
        point does not raise the temperature any further until all the liquid water is completely
        vaporized, point <m>1_g</m>. The heat added between <m>1_f</m> and <m>1_g</m> is the
          <em>Latent Heat of Vaporization</em>. After the steam has reached point <m>1_g</m>, any
        additional heat added causes the temperature to rise again, and the steam becomes
        superheated. </p>

<p> Superheated steam leaves the boiler at point <m>2</m> and enters the turbine. During the
        expansion process, the steam pressure and temperature both drop as energy is extracted from
        the steam. Steam leaves the turbine and enters the condenser at point <m>3</m>, which is
        saturated or wet steam. </p>
<p> In the condenser, heat is removed from the steam and it returns to the liquid state at
        point <m>4</m>. The feed pump raises the water pressure back up to the boiler pressure and
        the cycle begins again at point <m>1</m>. The feed pump causes a small temperature rise in
        the feedwater as well as a pressure increase. </p>
<p> The area under the curve from <m>1</m> to <m>2</m> represents the heat energy added in the
        boiler and the area under the curve from <m>3</m> to <m>4</m> represents the heat rejected
        to the ocean. The area inside the curve represents the net work done by the cycle. </p>

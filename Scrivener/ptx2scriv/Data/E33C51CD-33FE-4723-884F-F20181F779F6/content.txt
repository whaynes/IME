<p>The chemical energy stored in a battery is finite in quantity, and is measured as its
          <term>ampere-hour capacity</term>. As electric power is drawn from the battery, the
        chemical energy is depleted until the cells are discharged. Batteries are classified as
        either <term>primary</term> or <term>secondary</term> depending on whether they are
        discarded after discharge or are rechargeable, respectively. Most batteries used aboard ship
        are rechargeable after use.</p>
<p>
   <term>Dry cells</term> contain an <term>electrolyte</term> in a solid or semi-solid state,
        while <term>wet cells</term> contain a liquid electrolyte. Dry cells are commonly used for
        low-power purposes, as in flashlights and other portable equipment. and as back-up supplies
        for computers. Large, wet-cell <term>storage batteries</term> are used where higher power is
        required, such as for starting small auxiliary engines, and as short-term power supplies for
        emergency lighting and control circuits.</p>
<p>The two most common types of wet-cell storage batteries are the <term>lead-acid</term> and
        the <term>nickel-cadmium alkali (Nicad)</term> types. Generally, a battery is made up of a
        number of cells connected in series, with each cell delivering 1.5 volts or less. The state
        of charge of a battery is determined differently for each type. For leadâ€¢acid batteries the
        charge is determined by measuring the density of the electrolyte with a hydrometer, while
        the charge of the Nicad batteries is determined by measuring the cell voltage.</p>

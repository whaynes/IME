<p>When the rotor of an AC motor rotates, the magnetic field surrounding the rotor interacts
        with the stationary windings to induce a voltage in the windings. This induced voltage is
        opposite in polarity to the line voltage, and therefore it actually counteracts the effect
        of the line voltage at the motor terminals. An analogous effect occurs in DC motor
        armatures, where the induced voltage is called the <term>counter</term> or <term>back
          electromotive force</term>, or <term>back emf</term>. The induced voltage or back emf
        limits the current flow through the windings.</p>
<p>Since a motor rotor needs to be rotating to generate induced voltage or back emf, a motor
        which is just being started, whose rotor has not yet begun to turn, will have no such
        induced voltage or back emf. At starting, therefore, current will be limited only by the
        impedance and resistance of the motor windings. As a result, when full line voltage is
        applied to a motor at starting the <term>motor starting current</term> will be many times
        greater than the full-power running current. As the rotor accelerates, the induced voltage
        or back emf increases, and the current in the line and motor windings falls to normal
        values.</p>
<p>High starting currents have two negative effects, which affect large motors in particular.
        First, the high current in the windings can generate enough heat to damage the motor,
        especially if the driven load accelerates slowly. Second, the very high starting current can
        draw down line voltage sufficiently to cause lights to dim and other equipment being
        supplied from the same line to malfunction. For these reasons all DC motors and large AC
        motors are started with reduced voltage applied to the motor terminals by a <term>motor
          starter.</term>

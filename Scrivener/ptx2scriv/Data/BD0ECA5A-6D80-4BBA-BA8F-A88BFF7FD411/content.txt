<p> In this type of pump, the rotor is fitted with a number of slots into which movable
              vanes are installed. The pump chamber is larger in diameter than the rotor and the
              rotor is offset in the pump chamber so that they almost come in contact with each
              other at the 12 o’clock position and are separated by some distance at the 6 o’clock
              position. As the rotor revolves, the vanes are thrown out by centrifugal force to bear
              against the inside surface of the pump chamber. (Liquid pressure behind the vanes also
              pushes them in contact with the chamber wall and sometimes springs are used behind the
              vanes to force them against the chamber wall) As the rotor turns from the 12 o’clock
              position to the 6 o’clock position, it moves away from the chamber wall and liquid
              flows into the space between the moving vanes. From approximately the 5 o’clock to the
              7 o’clock position, the liquid is trapped between two vanes, the rotor and the chamber
              wall and is pushed to the discharge side of the pump. As the rotor revolves back to
              the 12 o’clock position, the space between the rotor and the chamber wall decreases,
              forcing the liquid to the discharge connection on the pump casing. Different designs
              of vanes may be used, as shown in <xref ref="vane_png"/>, but the sliding vane type is
              most common. </p>

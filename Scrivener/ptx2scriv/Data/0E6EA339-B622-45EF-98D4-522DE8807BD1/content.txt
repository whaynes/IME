<p> Since the absolute atmospheric pressure is always present, and acts on everything equally,
        we normally donâ€™t even notice it. Pressures are usually measured up or down from atmospheric
        pressure, and an ordinary pressure gage reads zero when it is subjected to atmospheric
        pressure only. Pressures measured in this way is called the gage pressure. It is important
        to distinguish between gage pressure and the absolute pressure described in the next
        section. </p>
